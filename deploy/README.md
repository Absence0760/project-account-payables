# deploy/ — minimal single-VM production stack

Operational files for the ~$20/month deployment described in
[`docs/minimal-deployment.md`](../docs/minimal-deployment.md) (read that
first — it holds the architecture, cost model, and the how-to-add-it-later
paths for everything this footprint leaves out).

The whole flow is four commands on a fresh VM:

```
./bootstrap-vm.sh                     # once: docker, compose, sops, swap, cron, IMDS fix
# copy the sops env in as deploy/.env.sops, log out/in (docker group), then:
./deploy.sh                           # every deploy: build, migrate, roll, verify
./add-tenant.sh acme --name "Acme" --admin-email admin@acme.com
```

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `bootstrap-vm.sh` | One-time, idempotent VM setup (Amazon Linux 2023): docker + compose plugin + sops + cronie (AL2023 ships no cron daemon) + AWS CLI, automatic security updates (dnf-automatic; docker/containerd excluded so the stack never bounces at a random hour), 2 GB swap, nightly backup cron, IMDSv2 hop-limit fix. Other distros get the manual list. |
| `compose.prod.yml` | Postgres (pgvector) + Redis (AOF) + API + Caddy. No DB host ports; S3 is real AWS. API healthcheck lets deploys verify themselves. Container logs capped (json-file, 10 MB × 5 per service) so they can't fill the 30 GB disk. `FEOH_DATABASE_URL`/`FEOH_REDIS_URL` are override seams for RDS/ElastiCache later. |
| `Caddyfile` | TLS + static SPA + `api.feohledger.com` reverse proxy. Domains via env. |
| `tenants.caddy.example` | Template for the per-VM tenant host list (`tenants.caddy`, gitignored). `add-tenant.sh` maintains it — manual edits rarely needed. |
| `deploy.sh` | Preflight → pull → decrypt secrets → dockerized frontend build (no Node/pnpm on the VM) → backend build → migrate (control plane + all tenants) **before** rolling → `up -d --wait` → Caddy reload. Flags: `--no-pull`, `--backend-only`, `--frontend-only`. |
| `add-tenant.sh` | Tenant DB + org + admin user (same `provision_tenant` path as signup) + Caddy host block + reload, in one shot. Generates a temp password (first-login change forced) unless `--admin-password` given. |
| `backup.sh` | Nightly pg dumps (globals + control plane + every `feoh_*` DB) streamed to S3. Cron installed by bootstrap. Optional `BACKUP_PING_URL` heartbeat (healthchecks.io-style) so silent failures get noticed. |
| `restore.sh` | The other half of the DR story: streams a night's dumps back from S3 — globals via psql, each DB via `pg_restore --create` (skips existing DBs unless `--force`). Stops the api for the duration, rolls the stack back up after. Test it once against a scratch stack. |
| `env.example` | Contract for the sops-encrypted env — `deploy.sh` validates the required keys against it. |

## Before the VM (once per project)

- AWS account + the `infra/` Terraform module applied (S3 buckets incl. the
  lifecycle-expired backups bucket — its `backups_bucket` output feeds
  `BACKUP_S3_BUCKET` — and the KMS key).
- EC2 `t4g.small` (Amazon Linux 2023 arm64 recommended), 30 GB gp3, ports
  80/443 open (TCP, plus UDP 443 — Caddy serves HTTP/3; without the UDP rule
  browsers silently fall back to HTTP/2). Instance profile: `kms:Decrypt` on
  the sops key; S3 read/write
  (`s3:GetObject/PutObject/AbortMultipartUpload/ListBucket`) on the
  invoice-files, audit-logs, and backup buckets; `ses:SendEmail` if using
  SES; ideally `ec2:ModifyInstanceMetadataOptions` so bootstrap can fix the
  IMDS hop limit itself.
- DNS: three records → this VM: `app.feohledger.com`, `api.feohledger.com`, and a
  **wildcard** `*.app.feohledger.com` (the wildcard makes tenant onboarding
  DNS-free; it needs no wildcard certificate — Caddy issues per-host certs).
- Secrets: author a real-valued copy of `env.example`, encrypt with sops into
  the **private** `infra-secrets` repo (per-project subdir + KMS key — see
  `~/github/project-mgmt/docs/secrets-management.md`), copy the encrypted
  file onto the VM as `deploy/.env.sops`. Never commit either file here —
  this repo is public.

## Deploys

`./deploy.sh` — it preflights its own prerequisites and required env keys,
runs migrations before the new API serves traffic, and fails loudly (via the
compose healthcheck) if the API doesn't come up. If the build or migration
step fails, the previously-running containers keep serving.

While you're in a deploy window: OS security patches auto-apply nightly
(dnf-automatic, installed by bootstrap), but **docker/containerd are excluded**
— their updates restart the daemon and would bounce the stack at a random
hour, and the exclude also hides them from dnf-automatic's own reporting.
Check them here, where a bounce is fine:
`sudo dnf upgrade --refresh 'docker*' 'containerd*'`

## Tenants

`./add-tenant.sh <slug> --name "Company" --admin-email admin@company.com` —
provisions everything and prints the login URL + temp password. Don't run
`scripts/seed.py` (demo data) in prod.

## Backups

Installed by bootstrap as `/etc/cron.d/feoh-backup` (03:17 UTC nightly,
logging to `/var/log/feoh-backup.log`). Set `BACKUP_PING_URL` in the sops env
to get a heartbeat ping after each successful run.

Restore with `./restore.sh <YYYY-MM-DD> [--force] [db ...]` — globals first,
then each DB via `pg_restore --create`, streamed straight from S3; existing
DBs are skipped unless `--force` (drop + recreate). A restore that fails
partway deliberately leaves the api stopped (don't serve a half-restored
stack) — fix the cause and re-run, or `docker compose -f compose.prod.yml up
-d --wait` to bring it back as-is. **Test a restore once against a scratch
stack before calling backups done.**
