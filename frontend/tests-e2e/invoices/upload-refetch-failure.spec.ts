/**
 * /invoices — the Upload button must recover when the post-upload REFETCH fails.
 *
 * Regression: `handleUpload` had no try/finally. The uploads themselves are
 * wrapped in `Promise.allSettled` (so a failed file can't throw), but the
 * `invoiceStore.fetch(...)` / `fetchCounts()` calls that follow are bare awaits.
 * A rejection there skipped `uploading = false` and `input.value = ''`, leaving
 * the button permanently disabled reading "Uploading…" — and because the file
 * input still held the same value, re-picking the same file wouldn't even fire
 * `change`. Only a full page reload recovered, and the user had no way to know
 * the upload had in fact succeeded.
 *
 * The list fetch is stubbed to fail exactly once, AFTER the upload lands, so the
 * spec drives the real failure rather than simulating the symptom.
