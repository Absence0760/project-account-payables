/**
 * /payments — the Cards table distinguishes loading / failed / genuinely empty.
 *
 * Every other list on this page already did: the Queue and History tabs, the
 * Runs tab (`tests-e2e/payments/runs-load-states.spec.ts`), and the Rebates
 * table stacked directly ABOVE this one on the same tab. The Cards table was
 * the last one here with no error flag at all, so a failed read rendered
 * "No virtual cards issued yet." — answering "we could not look" with "there is
 * nothing", permanently, with the toast that explained it already faded.
 *
 * `/exceptions` states the rule verbatim: never reintroduce an empty message
 * that outranks "we could not look".
 *
 * Stubbed so both states are deterministic: a real backend answers instantly
 * and never fails on demand. The assertions are scoped to
 * `[data-testid="cards-table"]` for the same reason `cards-pagination.spec.ts`
 * is — this tab stacks two tables, and a page-wide lookup reads the rebates
 * one.
