 *
 * **Why there is no `waitForLoadState('networkidle')` after the `goto`.**
 * This JSDoc used to carry one, and to justify it: Svelte 5 binds the form's
 * `onsubmit` only after hydration, so a click before that would fire the
 * native GET submit and navigate to /login?email=…&password=… — visually
 * identical to "still on /login" but with no auth POST attempted. That hazard
 * needs a form to exist in the pre-hydration document, and in this app one
 * never does. `routes/+layout.svelte` holds `hasTenant` as a tri-state that
 * starts `undefined` and is only assigned inside a `browser`-guarded
 * `$effect`; effects do not run during SSR or prerender, so the layout renders
 * its empty branch and `<slot/>` — the whole login page — is never emitted.
 * `pnpm build` shows it directly: the entire `build/` tree is one
 * `index.html` whose body is an empty `<div style="display: contents">`, with
 * no `<form>` and no `<input>` anywhere in the file, and `vite preview` (what
 * CI serves) hands that same fallback to every path including /login.
 *
 * So the email input cannot exist until hydration has run the layout effect
 * and rendered the login component — which creates the `<form onsubmit=…>` and
 * its inputs in one pass, with the handler attached at element creation
 * (`submit` is not in Svelte 5's delegated-event set, so there is no window
 * where the element exists unbound). `.fill()` auto-waits for that element,
 * which makes it a strictly stronger hydration gate than a quiet network ever
 * was: `networkidle` only ever claimed no request had been made for 500ms,
 * never that anything had rendered.
 *
 * Do not restore the wait here without restoring it in
 * `_ensureAdminStorageState` too — the two sign-in paths must agree.

/**
 * Delete the workflow definitions whose name starts with `namePrefix`, and

 *
 * `workflow_definitions` is referenced by three foreign keys and none of them
 * cascade — `workflow_versions.definition_id`,
 * `workflow_experiments.workflow_definition_id` and
 * `workflow_instances.definition_id`, the last itself referenced by
 * `workflow_steps.instance_id` — so a bare `DELETE FROM workflow_definitions`
 * only works while the definition happens to have no children. Ten workflow
 * specs each carried a byte-identical hand-rolled copy of that walk, differing
 * only in the marker they swept by: the same trap `deleteInvoicesWhere` and
 * `deleteVendorsWhere` were written for, plus the copies. The graph below was
 * read from `pg_constraint` in a live tenant database, not from any spec.
 *
 * Unlike its two siblings this takes a NAME PREFIX rather than a WHERE clause
 * body, because every caller sweeps by the marker it names its rows with, and
 * the predicate carries a seatbelt no caller should be able to drop:
 * `is_default = false`. That keeps a marker typo away from the seeded default
 * `fixtures/globalSetup.ts` asserts the whole suite against — and away from
 * the `Invoice Processing` stub `services/workflow_engine.py` mints as a
 * last-resort fallback for an org with no active definition, which is neither
 * seeded nor spec-created and whose deletion could leave a tenant with none.
 *
 * Sweeping by name rather than by id is what makes this teardown survive the
 * failures the callers' own `finally` blocks cannot: a create whose POST landed
 * before the nav or canvas render threw, and an interrupted run. It also
 * reaches a row the API refuses to delete — `DELETE /api/workflows/{id}` 409s
 * on an active definition and on one that is the snapshot source for an
 * in-flight invoice.

 * landed in the FIRST page. That holds only while the tenant is nearly empty.
 * The payments queue orders by `due_date ASC NULLS LAST, id` and pages at 20,
 * and the full local seed (`pnpm seed`, no `--lean`) already leaves ~23
 * payable invoices — so an API-created invoice with no due date sorts last and
 * lands on page 2. CI runs `seed.py --lean` (10 invoices/tenant), which is why
 * this only ever bit locally.
 *
 * The fix is to navigate to the row rather than assume its position: drive the
 * list's own "Load more" control until the row appears or the list is
 * exhausted. This is NOT a retry or a wait-longer — every step waits on a real
 * signal (the row count growing), and a genuinely absent row still fails the
