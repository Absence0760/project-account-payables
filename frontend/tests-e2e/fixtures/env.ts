/**
 * Where the e2e suite points — the frontend origin and the backend API base.
 *
 * Both were hardcoded (`:7777` in the per-worker `baseURL` fixture, `:8000` in
 * a handful of `process.env.PUBLIC_API_URL ?? …` repeats), and
 * `playwright.config.ts` reuses an existing server. A session working in a git
 * **worktree** therefore either tested the *primary* checkout's build without
 * noticing, or had to take the port from another session — worktrees isolate
 * files, not ports. Two round-24 agents hit exactly that; one stopped and
 * restarted a server it did not own.
 *
 * So the two origins come from the environment, defaulting to today's values —
 * an existing run is bit-for-bit unchanged, and a worktree can serve on its own
 * port:
 *
 *   E2E_WEB_ORIGIN=http://localhost:7801 PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8001 \
 *     pnpm test:e2e
 *
 * Everything else is DERIVED from `E2E_WEB_ORIGIN` — the per-tenant subdomain
 * origins, the post-login landing-URL pattern, the dev/preview server's port —
 * so there is one knob for the whole web half, not a port here and a hostname
 * there. Deliberately dependency-free (no `@playwright/test` import) so
 * `playwright.config.ts` can import it at config-load time alongside the
 * fixtures.

 * check), and it needs no DNS and no Chromium resolver rule at all. The code
 * path it exercises is identical to a real vanity hostname's:
 * `kind === 'vanity'` → no slug, same-origin `/api`.
 *
 * A literal connects only to the address the server actually BOUND, which is
 * why `playwright.config.ts` pins the dev/preview server to `--host 127.0.0.1`
 * rather than leaving it on Vite's `localhost` default (which resolves to `::1`
 * on at least one of the machines this runs on). See the comment there.
