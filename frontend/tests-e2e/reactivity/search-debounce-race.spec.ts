/**
 * Regression guard for GitHub issue #168.
 *
 * /invoices, /payments (history tab), and /vendors each have a search box
 * that's supposed to debounce at 300ms. The bug: the filter-change `$effect`
 * (status chips / advanced filters) called a params-builder that also read
 * `search` — and Svelte tracks reads transitively through called functions,
 * so that effect ended up depending on `search` too. Every keystroke re-fired
 * it immediately, bypassing the dedicated debounce timer entirely. On top of
 * that, nothing sequenced responses: a slow request for an earlier search
 * term could resolve after a faster later one and clobber the list with
 * stale results.
 *
 * The fix: the params-builder reads `search` via `untrack()` so only the
 * dedicated debounce effect (which reads `search` directly) triggers a
 * fetch, plus a monotonic request-token guard (`$lib/utils/requestSequence.ts`)
 * that discards a response superseded by a later request.
 *
 * Each route below proves both halves of the fix:
 *   (a) rapid typing coalesces into a single debounced request, not one
 *       immediate un-debounced request per keystroke.
 *   (b) a slow response for an earlier search term that resolves AFTER a
 *       faster later one is discarded — the final list stays correct.
 *
 * `/requisitions` and `/expenses` are here because their guards were written
 * locally in `tests-e2e/{requisitions,expenses}/search-scope.spec.ts` — as
 * hand-rolled copies of (a) — purely to avoid a merge conflict on this shared
 * file during a parallel round. Two copies of a technique drift; one table does
 * not. Those files keep the tests that are genuinely their own (server-side
 * search reaching a later page, the empty state, the CSV term, and the
 * requisitions sequencing test, which waits on a real issued-request signal and
 * is stronger than (b) rather than a copy of it).
 *
 * Those two routes also carry a failure mode the other four do not, and it is
 * the reason (a) has to TYPE rather than `fill()`: they hold an `appliedSearch`
 * state that cancels a pending debounce once the term it names has already been
 * requested. So an untracked-read slip there does not produce a duplicate
 * request — it produces one un-debounced request per keystroke and NO debounced
 * one, which a single-write `fill()` cannot distinguish from correct behaviour.
