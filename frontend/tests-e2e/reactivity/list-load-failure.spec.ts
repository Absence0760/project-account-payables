 * A failed list load must not read as an empty result set.
 *
 * The invoices / payments / contracts / expenses stores had no `catch`: a 500
 * or an offline backend left the list empty and the table rendered
 * "No … match your filters." — an outage indistinguishable from a filter that
 * matched nothing, on four of the app's busiest surfaces. Each store now
 * records `errored` (re-throwing, so callers that await a refresh keep their
 * own handling) and each page picks its empty message off it, the way
 * /notifications and /exceptions already did.
