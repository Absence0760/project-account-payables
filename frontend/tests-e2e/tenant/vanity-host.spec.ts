/**
 * Host-derived tenant + API-origin resolution (`$lib/tenant.ts` over
 * `$lib/hostRouting.ts`).
 *
 * ## What this spec covers, and what it deliberately doesn't
 *
 * The SPA is now platform-domain aware: a host under a domain listed in
 * `PUBLIC_PLATFORM_DOMAINS` carries the tenant slug as its first label and
 * calls the build-time `PUBLIC_API_URL`; ANY OTHER host is a customer's
 * white-label vanity domain, where the SPA must send **no** `X-Tenant-Slug`
 * (a present header suppresses the backend's `Host` lookup) and must call
 * `/api` **same-origin** (only a same-origin request carries the vanity
 * hostname in `Host` for the backend to resolve the tenant from).
 *
 * **Both halves are covered here now.** Two things had to become true first,
 * and both are worth knowing before touching this file:
 *
 *   1. `PUBLIC_PLATFORM_DOMAINS` reaches BOTH run modes. Locally the suite
 *      boots `pnpm dev`, which reads it from `playwright.config.ts`'s
 *      `webServer.env`; CI sets `FEOH_E2E_USE_PREVIEW=true` and serves a
 *      `vite build` bundle, where it is baked in by the build step's own env.
 *      Both take it from `fixtures/env.ts::PLATFORM_DOMAINS`, so they cannot
 *      disagree — which they must not, because unset means "replay the
 *      pre-change rule", under which no host is a vanity host at all.
 *      **That failure is loud, not silent:** with the variable missing,
 *      `127.0.0.1` classifies as a 4-label platform host with slug `127`, so
 *      the two assertions below fail rather than quietly asserting the
 *      opposite thing.
 *   2. A second origin that serves both the SPA and `/api`. It is the loopback
 *      **IP literal** (`fixtures/env.ts::VANITY_ORIGIN`): every hostname the
 *      harness can reach is `*.localhost`, and `localhost` is exactly what
 *      `PUBLIC_PLATFORM_DOMAINS` declares, so no `.localhost` name can ever
 *      classify as vanity — while an IP literal is never a platform host
 *      unless listed verbatim. `vite.config.ts` proxies `/api` on the same
 *      origin (with `changeOrigin: false`, so the vanity `Host` survives),
 *      which is the operator requirement a real vanity deployment carries
 *      (`docs/white-label.md` § Custom domains); and `playwright.config.ts`
 *      pins the server to `--host 127.0.0.1`, because an IP literal only
 *      connects to the address the server actually bound and Vite's `localhost`
 *      default resolves to `::1` on some machines.
 *
 * Nothing here is stubbed: both describes assert on the requests the SPA
 * actually issues. What the vanity half deliberately does NOT assert is that
 * the backend then resolves a tenant from that `Host` — that needs the origin
 * registered in a tenant's `settings.brand.custom_domains`, which is a
 * cross-org-unique write and belongs to the backend's own coverage
 * (`backend/tests/test_tenant_custom_domain.py`). The half that was
 * unreachable, and is now reachable, is the SPA's: what it sends and where.
