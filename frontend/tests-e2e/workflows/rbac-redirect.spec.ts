/**
 * `/workflows` and `/workflows/[id]` — the non-admin redirect guard.
 *
 * **What this closes.** `$lib/nav.ts` gates the Workflows row to
 * `roles: ['admin']`, but every READ under `/api/workflows` is
 * `get_current_user` — list, detail, templates, versions, diff, simulate,
 * export — and only the mutations are `require_roles(ROLE_ADMIN)`. So a
 * non-admin never saw the nav row but could type either URL, and neither page
 * shipped a read-only mode: what they reached was the full editing surface
 * (New Workflow, From Template, Import, per-row Delete, the bulk bar; on the
 * builder, an editable canvas and a Save), every control 403ing on click. A
 * dead end that looks like a working page.
 *
 * **Why the API leg of these tests asserts 200, not 403.** Every sibling
 * "ap_clerk is redirected away and the API 403s them" spec
 * (`admin/sweep-health`, `admin/api-keys`, `admin/webhooks`, `admin/partner`,
 * `admin/retention`, `admin/privacy`, `admin/access-review`) can pin BOTH
 * halves because those endpoints are role-gated. This one cannot, and the
 * difference is the point: the guard here reproduces the **nav's** gate, not
 * the backend's. Asserting the read still succeeds keeps that asymmetry in
 * front of whoever revisits it — the product question of whether the nav
 * should instead be WIDENED to match these role-open reads is open in
 * `docs/followups.md`, and a spec that quietly asserted 403 would read as
 * evidence it had been settled the other way.
 *
 * If that call ever goes to "widen", the fix is to widen the page's `allowed`
 * and add the read-only mode `/organization` carries — these two redirect
 * cases then flip to asserting a populated, non-editable page. Deleting the
 * guard and going back to a page of buttons that cannot work is not an option
 * either way, which is what the "no editable control ever rendered" assertions
 * below are really pinning.
