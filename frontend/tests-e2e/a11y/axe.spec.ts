/**
 * Automated accessibility regression guard (WCAG 2.2 Level AA).
 *
 * Runs axe-core against the key surfaces of the app at the WCAG 2.0/2.1/2.2
 * A + AA tag set and asserts zero violations. This is the automated leg of the
 * conformance posture documented in `docs/accessibility.md` /
 * `docs/accessibility-vpat.md` — it catches the machine-detectable regressions
 * (missing labels, contrast, ARIA misuse, landmark/heading structure, target
 * size) so a future change can't silently undo the a11y fixes this initiative
 * landed. Manual screen-reader passes (VoiceOver / NVDA / TalkBack) cover the
 * criteria axe can't assert; see the docs.
 *
 * Pattern: reuses the per-worker `e2e<N>` tenant + storage-state fixtures from
 * `fixtures/helpers.ts` exactly like every other spec — the authenticated specs
 * inherit the default admin storage state; the two unauthenticated surfaces
 * (the AP login page and the supplier portal login) opt out of it.
 *
 * It is auto-discovered by the normal `pnpm test:e2e` run (the config's
 * `testDir: '.'` walks recursively), so CI catches a11y regressions on every
 * push. `pnpm test:e2e:a11y` (frontend/package.json) targets just this folder
 * for a fast focused run.

/**
 * Authenticated surfaces — the core invoice → approve → pay flow plus a
 * representative sample of the rest of the app shell. Each navigates as the
 * worker's admin (default storage state) and asserts axe-clean.
 *
 * `ready` is the page's own `<h1>`, waited on **in addition to** the sidebar.
 * The sidebar renders before a route's own fetch resolves, so on a page that
 * loads its data (every `/admin` route, `/vendor-statements`) the sidebar alone
 * would let axe scan a loading frame — passing on markup no user ever sees.
 * Omit it for the routes that render their shell synchronously.
