/**
 * Accessibility regression guard for the **KPI "no figure yet" affordance**
 * (`$lib/components/ui/KpiCard.svelte` + `$lib/utils/kpiValue.ts`).
 *
 * The convention this guards, in the order the component applies it:
 *
 *   - A figure that does not exist renders `KPI_NO_FIGURE` (an em dash), never
 *     a coerced `0` — `docs/decisions.md` §34 in a display layer.
 *   - **Whether it is missing because it is still arriving is ANNOUNCED, not
 *     drawn.** A pending card is pixel-identical to an unavailable one; it
 *     differs only in `aria-busy="true"`, an `aria-hidden` dash, and a
 *     screen-reader-only "Loading…" in the dash's place. A placeholder must
 *     never be read out as a value.
 *   - A pending or unavailable card drops its highlight tint, because the tint
 *     is a *verdict* and there is no figure to have a verdict about.
 *   - A genuine computed `0` is a figure: it renders as one, keeps its verdict
 *     tint, and is never announced as pending. The classification is nullish,
 *     not falsy.
 *
 * **Why this spec exists separately from `axe.spec.ts`.** That suite scans
 * routes; this scans *states*. Every assertion below needs the KPI response
 * held or shaped, and none of the three routes reaches the pending state for
 * long enough to be scanned incidentally — a route list would report the page
 * clean while the busy affordance went entirely unchecked. It is the same
 * argument `deemphasised-rows.spec.ts` makes for de-emphasised rows.
 *
 * **Why axe alone would not be enough here.** axe cannot see the interesting
 * part: a dash left inside the accessibility tree while the card claims to be
 * busy is valid ARIA and violates no rule — it just reads "em dash" to a
 * screen-reader user where a number belongs. So each test asserts the
 * *announced* content directly, via Playwright's accessibility-tree snapshot
 * (`locator.ariaSnapshot()`), and runs axe on top of that.
 *
 * The pending state is reached by holding the route's own KPI response on a
 * promise released by hand — the pattern
 * `tests-e2e/admin/api-keys.spec.ts`'s usage-identity test establishes. No
 * sleep, no timeout, no race: the readiness gate is the rendered
 * `data-kpi-state`, and the response is released only once the pending
 * assertions have run.
