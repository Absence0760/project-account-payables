/**
 * Accessibility regression guard for WCAG 2.2 AA, SC 2.5.8 Target Size
 * (Minimum) — **row-select checkboxes** (the design-system control) and the
 * **branding colour field** (a page-level control that lost the criterion to a
 * CSS specificity tie).
 *
 * **This guard is verified red-to-green, not asserted to be one.** The round
 * that landed the checkbox fix could not run Playwright, so it shipped this
 * file unexecuted; it has since been run against the pre-fix `app.css`
 * (`width/height: 16px`, a 1px opaque border, `margin: 0`, `outline: none` on
 * focus) and **five of the six checkbox cases fail** there — target 16 vs the
 * 24 floor (×3), the painted/margin box measuring 14 rather than 16, and
 * `outline-style: none`. Do not weaken an assertion here without re-running
 * that experiment: the value of this file is entirely in the failures it
 * produces, and the sixth case used to produce none (see its own comment).
 *
 * The criterion asks for a 24×24 CSS-px target, OR — through its *spacing*
 * exception — an undersized target whose 24px-diameter circle reaches no other
 * target. `input[type=checkbox]` is painted 16×16, so for years it cleared
 * 2.5.8 only through that exception, and whether it did was decided by the
 * padding each page gave its checkbox column rather than by anything in the
 * design system. `app.css` now grows the *hit box* to 24×24 (a 4px transparent
 * border, `background-clip: padding-box`, and a matching -4px margin so the
 * margin box — and therefore every row height — is still 16×16), which means
 * the SIZE half of the criterion is met outright and the neighbour geometry
 * stops mattering.
 *
 * **Why this spec exists separately from `axe.spec.ts`.** That suite already
 * scans `/invoices`, and it passed throughout — because whether the first row's
 * checkbox is even *in scope* for the rule depends on tenant state. A disabled
 * input is not focusable, so axe's `widget-not-inline-matches` skips it
 * entirely, and every `SYSTEM_MANAGED_STATUSES` row (`pending`, `paid`,
 * `done`, …) renders its checkbox disabled. A seeded tenant whose visible rows
 * are all system-managed therefore hands axe no selectable checkbox to measure,
 * and the scan reports the page clean without having looked. Playwright runs
 * spec folders alphabetically, so `a11y/` sees the tenant *before* the
 * `invoices/` specs add rows to it — the coverage was an artefact of file
 * ordering. Each test here rewrites the list response so a selectable row is
 * guaranteed on screen, then asserts the geometry directly as well as through
 * axe.
 *
 * The complement is the static scan `src/lib/a11y/targetSizeAudit.test.ts`,
 * which catches the base rule being weakened anywhere in the tree without
 * needing a route to render it. Neither subsumes the other: the scan cannot
 * resolve the cascade, and axe cannot see a state no listed route reaches.

/**
 * Retire the response-rewriting route handler before the test does.
 *
 * `makeFirstRowSelectable` intercepts the invoice list and calls
 * `route.fetch()` to get the real payload back. `/invoices` keeps issuing list
 * and count requests while the page settles, so a handler can still be inside
 * that `await` when the last assertion resolves and Playwright tears the test
 * down — surfacing as `route.fetch: Test ended.` / `apiResponse.json: Response
 * has been disposed`, attributed to whichever test owned the handler. It is a
 * harness race, not an app defect, and it took down the two SHORTEST tests here
 * (the select-all case and the sweep, which assert and finish before a
 * page-load request has come back) on a CI shard, one of them hard enough to
 * kill the worker.
 *
 * `unrouteAll({ behavior: 'ignoreErrors' })` is the documented remedy and the
 * idiom this suite already uses (`bank-reconciliation.spec.ts`): it waits for
 * running handlers and discards the teardown-only errors. Deliberately NOT a
 * try/catch inside the handler falling back to `route.continue()` — that would
 * let a genuinely failed fetch through un-rewritten, so the test would pass
 * having measured a checkbox it never made selectable.
