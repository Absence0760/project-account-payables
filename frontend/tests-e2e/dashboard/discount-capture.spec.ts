/**
 * Dashboard — early-payment discount capture.
 *
 * `GET /api/dashboard`'s `discount_capture` block has carried a three-way
 * captured / missed / PENDING fold plus `*_amount_reporting` +
 * `unconverted_count` since round 16 with NO frontend consumer at all. These
 * specs pin the two things that make surfacing it honest rather than harmful:
 *
 *   1. a still-open discount window renders as capturable, never as a miss;
 *   2. a figure that could not convert some rows SAYS so where it is read.
 *
 * The dashboard response is stubbed so both states are actually on screen —
 * a seeded tenant reliably produces neither.
 *
 * The payload itself lives in `./fixture.ts`, typed `satisfies DashboardData`.
 * The copy this spec used to hand-maintain omitted `aging_reporting`'s
 * `unconverted_count` and nothing noticed, because `pnpm check` does not
 * typecheck `tests-e2e/`; `pnpm check:e2e` does. See that module's header.
 */

/**
 * Both chart series are left EMPTY on purpose: this spec owns the discount
 * card, and `unconverted-disclosures.spec.ts` owns the three chart notices.
 * Every other count in the fixture is zero, so neither those notices nor the
 * KPI-row rollup banner can fire and be mistaken for this card's own.
