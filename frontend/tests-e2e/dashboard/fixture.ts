// own esbuild transform does not read that file. A `import type` is erased
// before the runtime ever sees it, so this costs nothing at test time — a
// VALUE import from `$lib` here would fail to resolve when Playwright loads
// the spec. Keep app *values* out of the e2e tree; app *types* are what make

/**
 * The one `GET /api/dashboard` stub the dashboard specs build on.

 * **Why it is shared, and why it is typed.** Both dashboard specs used to
 * carry their own hand-written copy of this payload, and nothing compared
 * either against the shape the page reads — `pnpm check` extends
 * `.svelte-kit/tsconfig.json`, whose `include` covers `../src/**` and not
 * `tests-e2e`. The drift that cost: the stub omitted `unconverted_count` on
 * `aging_reporting`, `undefined > 0` is false, and the partial-conversion
 * disclosure the spec existed to exercise could only ever render its
 * no-notice branch. Two files, one omission, no signal.
 *
 * `satisfies DashboardData` is what makes that a compile error now — but ONLY
 * because `tsconfig.e2e.json` puts this tree in a real TypeScript program and
 * `pnpm check:e2e` runs it in CI. A `satisfies` in an unchecked tree is
 * decoration; the two land together on purpose.
