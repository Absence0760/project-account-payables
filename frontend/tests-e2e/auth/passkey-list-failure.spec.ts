 * `/profile` → Passkeys, when the passkey list can't be loaded.
 *
 * `GET /api/auth/mfa/passkey` failing used to be swallowed into
 * `passkeys = []`, which is a *claim*: the card said "No passkeys yet", and —
 * worse — the step-up decision is built on that same array. With
 * `needsPasskeyStepUp` reading false, Add/Remove submitted with no proof at
 * all, and `POST /auth/mfa/passkey/register` answered the opaque step-up 400
 * for any account that actually does hold a factor.
 *
 * The unknown list now stays unknown: the card says so and offers a retry, and
 * the step-up requirement fails CLOSED (a proof is asked for, and the passkey
 * ceremony stays on offer because the server — not this list — owns the
 * credential set).
