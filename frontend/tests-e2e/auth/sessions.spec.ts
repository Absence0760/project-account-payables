// signing in as the CLERK below, so `revoke-others` never reaches it.)

 * is covered by pytest; this is the UI panel end-to-end.
 *
 * The contract under test is the one that actually protects a user: "Sign out
 * everywhere else", clicked on the device you trust, makes the OTHER device's
 * token stop working — not merely disappear from a list.
