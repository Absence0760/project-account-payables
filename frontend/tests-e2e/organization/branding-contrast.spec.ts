/**
 * /organization → Branding panel, strong-accent contrast advisory.
 *
 * `brandThemeVars` writes `accent_strong_color` straight into the
 * `--accent-strong` custom property, whose one contract is that white text
 * sits on it — every primary button, active filter chip and the skip link read
 * off it. So a tenant picking their logo yellow makes those unreadable app-wide,
 * and the stylesheet token-pairing guard (`src/lib/a11y/tokenPairing.test.ts`)
 * structurally cannot see it: that scan runs over the sources, this override
 * happens at runtime.
 *
 * The advisory is exactly that — advisory. The backend accepts any valid hex
 * and the brand is the tenant's call; what this asserts is that the cost is
 * stated before it's saved. Nothing here saves.
 *
 * Purely client-side (no request is made), so the test types and asserts —
 * no network wait, no timeout. Selectors are the field's placeholder (the
 * `DEFAULT_ACCENT_STRONG` constant the page renders) and the warning's
 * `data-testid`.
