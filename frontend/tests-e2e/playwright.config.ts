/**
 * Playwright e2e config for the frontend.
 *
 * The frontend reads tenant context from the subdomain
 * (`<slug>.localhost:7777`). Chromium resolves `*.localhost` to
 * 127.0.0.1 by default per RFC 6761, so no /etc/hosts changes are
 * needed.
 *
 * Parallelism + isolation model:
 *
 *   - CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): 14 shards × workers=1. Each
 *     shard is its own GitHub runner with its own Postgres + Redis +
 *     seeded backend (one tenant, e2e1), runs `--shard=N/14` of the
 *     test list serially. Total parallelism = 14 across machines.
 *     Tests inside a shard share the shard's single tenant, but
 *     they run *sequentially* — no within-shard worker contention,
 *     which was the source of the spec-to-spec interference we hit
 *     under the previous 4×4=16 model.
 *   - Local (no `--shard` flag): workers default to 4 for a fast
 *     iteration loop. Each worker is pinned to its own `e2e<N>`
 *     tenant via the worker-scoped `tenantSlug` fixture in
 *     `fixtures/helpers.ts`. Specs within a worker share that
 *     worker's tenant. Override with `PLAYWRIGHT_WORKERS=1` if a
 *     flake suggests within-worker spec interference.
 *
 * Seed (`backend/scripts/seed.py`) honors `AP_E2E_TENANT_COUNT`
 * (default 4) — CI sets it to 1 so each shard only provisions
 * one e2e tenant.
 *
 * The seeded `acme` + `techflow` tenants stay around for the
 * cross-tenant-isolation specs that need fixed slugs
 * (`tenant-isolation.spec.ts`, `cross-tenant-writes.spec.ts`).
 *
 * Prereqs (CI handles all of these):
 *   - Postgres running on :5432
 *   - Redis running on :6379
 *   - `python backend/scripts/seed.py` has run (creates acme +
 *     techflow + the e2e tenants)
 *   - Backend running on :8000 (set PUBLIC_API_URL accordingly)
 *
 * Locally, `cd frontend && pnpm test:e2e` boots the dev server via
 * the webServer block below. The backend has to be running
 * separately.
