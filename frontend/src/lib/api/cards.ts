// Typed helpers for the virtual-card REBATE lifecycle — the three endpoints
// that let AP record what the card processor did out-of-band. Everything routes
// through the shared `api` client (Bearer + X-Tenant-Slug + X-Entity-ID +
// 401-bounce), like every other `$lib/api/*` module.
//
// All three are `require_roles(admin, ap_manager, cfo)` on the server — a ROLE
// gate, not one of the granular `payment.*` permissions the recovery exits in
// `./payments.ts` use, because a rebate is bookkeeping rather than a money
// movement. The UI mirrors that with `auth.hasAnyRole(...)` so a clerk never
// sees a control that can only 403.
//
// **None of these moves money.** The card settlement webhook creates every
// rebate at `pending`; Lithic/Nium confirm and pay rebates on a periodic
// statement, not on an event we ingest, so `confirm` / `mark-paid` record a
// confirmation and a payout that already happened elsewhere. Neither requests a
// payout, and neither pays anyone.
//
// See `backend/docs/virtual-cards.md` § Rebate status lifecycle.
