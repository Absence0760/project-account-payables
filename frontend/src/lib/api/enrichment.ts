// Typed helpers for the two *history-derived* enrichment reads — the vendor
// performance score and the per-invoice auto-fill suggestions. Both are
// advisory, compute-on-read, and mutate nothing; the backend derives them
// deterministically from the tenant's own approved invoice history (no external
// call, no cloud key). Backend: `backend/app/api/enrichment.py`, documented in
// `backend/docs/data-enrichment.md`.
//
// The *external* firmographics enrichment (D&B / Clearbit) deliberately stays
// in `api/vendors.ts` next to the rest of the vendor stewardship writes — it
// calls a third party and has an apply endpoint. These two have neither, which
// is why they live apart rather than being appended there.
//
// Routes through the shared `api` client (Bearer + X-Tenant-Slug + X-Entity-ID
// + 401-bounce) — never raw fetch. Every numeric field arrives as a STRING
// (the backend's exact-Decimal wire convention); render them, never do money or
// score arithmetic on them client-side.
