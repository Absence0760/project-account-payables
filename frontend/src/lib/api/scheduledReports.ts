/**
 * Typed helpers for the scheduled-report admin surface. Routes through the
 * shared `api` client (Bearer + X-Tenant-Slug + 401-bounce) — never raw fetch.
 * Backend: `backend/app/api/analytics.py` (JWT + RBAC gated).
 *
 * RBAC, mirrored by the UI: read is `admin` + `cfo`; create / patch / delete
 * are `admin` ONLY (the backend 403s the rest, so the panel gates the mutate
 * controls on `auth.isAdmin` rather than letting a CFO click into a 403).
 *
 * `X-Entity-ID` rides every request from `api.ts` but the scheduled-report
 * routes do NOT honour it — a schedule is whole-tenant by construction. That is
 * why the panel shows no entity selector: there is nothing for it to scope.
 *
 * Errors: every helper lets the shared `ApiError` propagate. `api.ts` already
 * runs the FastAPI `detail` through `formatApiDetail`, which renders a 422
 * validation list as `field: msg` and reads ONLY `loc` + `msg` — never `input`.
 * That matters here: `input` on a recipients failure is the submitted address
 * list, and echoing it would put a recipient's email address into a toast. So a
 * caller surfaces `e.message` as-is; there is no per-message mapping table to
 * drift from the backend's own wording.
