// Typed helpers for the payment-path RECOVERY exits — the endpoints that exist
// to un-strand money that has already moved, or to finish a reversal whose
// best-effort leg did not land. Everything routes through the shared `api`
// client (Bearer + X-Tenant-Slug + X-Entity-ID + 401-bounce).
//
// Each mirrors its server gate in the UI so a holder-less role never sees a
// control that can only 403: `retryRunErpSync` / `acceptPaymentSettlement` are
// `payment.execute` (`PERM_PAYMENT_EXECUTE`), `voidPayment` /
// `retryVoidCardCancel` are `payment.void` (`PERM_PAYMENT_VOID`). None of them
// moves money — they report money that already moved, close out a payable the
// rail short-paid, reverse the books, or shut a card the void could not.
//
// See `backend/docs/payments.md` § ERP Payment Sync + § Settlement-amount
// verification + § Voiding a card payment.
