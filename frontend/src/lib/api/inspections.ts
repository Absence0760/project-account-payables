// the 4th leg of 4-way matching. All requests route through the shared `api`
// client (Bearer + X-Tenant-Slug + X-Entity-ID + 401-bounce).
//
// RBAC mirrors `backend/app/api/inspections.py`:
//   - `GET /api/inspections` + `GET /api/inspections/{id}` — any authenticated
//     user (`get_current_user`). The list is entity-scoped; the detail is not.
//   - `POST /api/inspections` + `POST /api/inspections/sync` — admin /
//     ap_manager (`require_roles`). `/goods-receipts` gates its controls on the
//     same split via `auth.isManager`; the backend is authoritative regardless.
//
// The list endpoint is deliberately unpaginated on the backend (no `page` /
// `page_size` params), so there is no pagination shape to model here.
