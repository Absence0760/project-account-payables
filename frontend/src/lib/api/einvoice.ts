 * 2.1 / UN-CEFACT CII, plus the four national formats) that a receiver's own
 * AP system can ingest, and every dialect is tax-validated before it is
 * emitted — a document that would be non-compliant is refused with a 422
 * rather than downloaded. See `backend/docs/e-invoicing.md` and
 * `backend/docs/peppol.md`.
 *
 * All requests route through the shared `api` client (Bearer + X-Tenant-Slug +
 * X-Entity-ID + the 401 clear-and-bounce), so this module never hand-rolls a
 * `fetch` and can't drift from the rest of the app's transport.
