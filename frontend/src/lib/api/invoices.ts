/**
 * Route an inter-company charge — generate the mirror **payable** under the
 * counterparty entity (`POST /api/invoices/{id}/route-intercompany`).
 *
 * Returns the MIRROR invoice, not the origin: the origin's own
 * `intercompany_mirror_id` is set by the same call, so a caller that renders
 * the origin must re-read it (or the list) afterwards rather than assuming the
 * response is the row it started from.
 *
 * Gated `admin` / `ap_manager` (clerks and CFO excluded — see the router's
 * `require_roles`). The backend refuses a counterparty equal to the invoice's
 * own entity with a 400 ("an entity cannot bill itself") and an unknown entity
 * id with a 404; both arrive as an `ApiError` carrying the backend's own
 * PII-free `detail`, so render `e.message` rather than inventing copy.
 *
 * Idempotent by construction: the origin is row-locked, the service
 * short-circuits on an existing `intercompany_mirror_id` and returns the SAME
 * mirror, and `uq_invoice_intercompany_mirror` turns a genuine race into a
 * clean 409. A second deliberate call is therefore never how the UI should
 * behave — once `intercompany_mirror_id` is set, show the routed state.
 * See `backend/docs/inter-company.md`.
