/**
 * Pure display helpers for the scheduled-reports panel.
 *
 * Kept out of the component (and unit-tested beside it, the same way
 * `routes/cfo/openingBalanceNotice.ts` is) because two of them encode a
 * CONTRACT, not styling:
 *
 *  1. **The auto-disabled state.** The runner disables a schedule after 5
 *     consecutive failures and records the streak as a `[retry N]` prefix on
 *     `last_run_error`. A schedule that silently stopped emailing is the exact
 *     failure this panel exists to make visible, so it must be distinguishable
 *     from one an admin paused on purpose — same `enabled: false`, completely
 *     different remedy. Deriving it in one tested function is what stops the
 *     two collapsing into a single "Disabled" pill again.
 *  2. **The label fallback.** `report_type` / `cadence` vocabularies come off
 *     the runner's own registries and ride the list response. A key we have no
 *     translation for must still RENDER — humanised — so that adding a report
 *     type on the backend makes it selectable here for free instead of
 *     invisible. Hardcoding either list is the bug this guards against.
