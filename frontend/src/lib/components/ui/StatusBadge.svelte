	/* WCAG 1.4.3 — these badges are small but bold uppercase, so they are held
	   to the normal-text bar (≥4.5:1), not the large-text one.

	   This component worked out the lifted-text answer for the tinted-badge
	   recipe before the palette had a name for it, and carried the resulting
	   hexes as private literals. They are now the `--<tone>-tint` /
	   `--<tone>-on-tint` pairs in app.css — same values, one owner — so a tone
	   is recalibrated in one place instead of here and in the 20-odd badges
	   that copied these numbers. See `frontend/CLAUDE.md` § Colour tokens and
	   contrast, and decisions.md §30.

	   Two drifts went with the move: `.done` and `.ready_for_review` had two
	   different greens (a 15% tint of #1fa86a vs of #32c882) that composite
	   within a few units of each other, so the difference was accidental
	   rather than meaningful; and `.failed` / `.pending` gain a little margin
	   (4.74→5.36 and 4.87→5.50) by taking the tokens' text. */

	/* The one tone with no palette entry: purple carries no semantic meaning
	   the other four share — it exists to make "handed to the ERP" scannable
	   mid-pipeline — so naming it would add a token with one caller. Kept as

	   tint composites to 5.59:1. */
