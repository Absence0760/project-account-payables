	 * the server rejected). This is `role="status"` / `aria-live="polite"`:
	 * it appears and updates as the field changes, so an assertive live
	 * region would interrupt the user on every keystroke.
	 *
	 * Render nothing by passing `show={false}` — the element leaves the DOM,
	 * which is what makes the polite region announce on its next appearance.
