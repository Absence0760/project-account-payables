	 * (cancelled / not-applicable) — deliberately NOT a tint, because a tint
	 * reads as a signal and these states are the absence of one.
	 * `erp` is the one measured literal: purple carries no semantic the five
	 * tones share (it exists to make "handed to the ERP" scannable
	 * mid-pipeline), so it stays a literal here rather than becoming a palette
	 * token with a single caller. See `StatusBadge.svelte` and decisions.md §30.

	/**
	 * The shared tinted-badge primitive — ONE owner of the
	 * `background: var(--<tone>-tint); color: var(--<tone>-on-tint)` recipe.
	 *
	 * Why it exists: 202 CSS rules across the app hand-rolled that recipe as an
	 * `rgba()` plus a literal hex — 44 distinct spellings of these five tones.
	 * Every one of them passed the contrast guard, so this is design-system
	 * debt rather than a defect; but the same tone written four ways is exactly
	 * how the 29 sub-4.5:1 badges accumulated unnoticed before decisions.md §30
	 * fixed them. A caller that names a *tone* can't spell it wrong, and a tone
	 * that is later recalibrated moves in one place.
	 *
	 * `variant` is passed straight through as an extra class so a call site
	 * keeps its own semantic hook (`.badge.approved`, `.badge.violation`) — the
	 * e2e suite selects on those, and they stay meaningful as selectors even
	 * though their *colour* rules are retired when a site converts. Do not
	 * reintroduce colour rules for a variant in the calling component: pick the
	 * tone here instead.
	 *
	 * Sizing is fixed on purpose. Call sites varied padding by a pixel or two
	 * with no intent behind the difference; one size is the point of a shared
	 * primitive. A badge that genuinely needs different metrics (a dense table
	 * chip, an oversized hero pill) is a different component, not a prop.
