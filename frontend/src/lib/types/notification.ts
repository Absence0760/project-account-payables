 * two drift, because the failure mode is silent: `notification_dispatch
 * .resolve_prefs` defaults a *missing* preference key to **on**, so an event
 * the frontend never lists is an event the user cannot switch off. Three of
 * these (`contract_renewal_due`, `chat_message`, `cash_shortfall_projected`)
 * shipped server-side while this union still stopped at the four `invoice_*`
 * ones — `chat_message` emails the AP team on every supplier-portal message,
 * with no way to mute it from the UI.
