/**
 * Vendor-facing status PHASES for the supplier portal.
 *
 * The supplier portal is not the internal AP console: a vendor doesn't need
 * to distinguish `sending_to_erp` from `posted_in_erp`, and the raw
 * workflow-engine / payment-rail enum values (see
 * `backend/app/models/invoice.py::InvoiceStatus` and
 * `backend/app/schemas/payment.py::PaymentStatus`) are internal jargon that
 * must never render verbatim in front of a supplier (persona-supplier audit
 * finding, issue #328).
 *
 * These maps collapse the internal state machines into the handful of phases
 * a vendor actually cares about — Submitted / Processing / Approved / Paid /
 * Rejected — while staying keyed on the SAME `InvoiceStatus` /
 * `PaymentStatus` types the internal app uses (`$lib/types/invoice`,
 * `$lib/types/payment`): a `Record<InvoiceStatus, …>` fails typechecking here
 * until a new backend status is classified, instead of falling through to the
 * raw string.
 *
 * **A phase is an ID, not a label.** It used to be the English label itself:
 * the chip set was derived by `Object.entries(LABELS)` grouping statuses whose
 * label STRING matched, so the phase identity WAS the display text. That makes
 * i18n a data change rather than a presentation one — translate "Processing"
 * and the four statuses behind it stop grouping (each lands in its own chip),
 * or two phases whose translations collide silently merge into one. The
 * identity is now a stable snake_case id ({@link PortalInvoicePhase} /
 * {@link PortalPaymentPhase}), the display text is a message key, and the
 * status→phase assignment is written out rather than inferred — so a label
 * edit in any of the six catalogues cannot move a status between chips.
 *
 * The phase id is also what `?phase=` carries in the portal list URLs. The
 * WIRE values are unchanged: each chip still sends the raw internal `status=`
 * values behind it, exactly as before.
