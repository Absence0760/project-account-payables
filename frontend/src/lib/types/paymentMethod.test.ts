/**
 * Drift guard: the frontend payment-method vocabulary must cover every rail the
 * backend can stamp onto `payments.method`, and every listed method must have a
 * non-empty display label (a missing one renders a blank cell in the payments
 * method dropdowns / History column).
 *
 * Sources (backend):
 *   - `app/schemas/payment.py::PaymentMethod` — ach, wire, check, virtual_card,
 *     and the UK domestic rails bacs / faster_payments / chaps (issue #328).
 *   - `services/payment_corridor.CORRIDOR_OVERRIDE_FEES` selects the same rails.
 *
 * The UK rails were added so a same-currency GBP→GB payment routes onto Faster
 * Payments instead of falling through to `international_wire` (SWIFT + a 2.5 %
 * fee anchor).
