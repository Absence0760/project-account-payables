// Types + PURE display helpers for the multi-route corridor quote optimizer

//
// The endpoint prices ONE payable invoice across every processor the org has
// configured and ranks them. It is **advisory and read-only**: it books no
// `Payment`, claims no run, touches no invoice, and does not decide which rail
// pays. Which bank actually moves the money still comes from
// `payment_corridor.pick_corridor` + the org's configured provider. The
// response says so itself (`advisory: true`), and the UI must never imply that
// looking at a comparison selected anything.
//
// Kept free of `$lib/api` (and therefore of `$app/*`) so the helpers below stay
// unit-testable under vitest's plain-node environment — the same split
// `types/recurring.ts` and `types/vendorStatementRecon.ts` use.
//
// See `backend/docs/international-payments.md` § Multi-route quote optimization.
