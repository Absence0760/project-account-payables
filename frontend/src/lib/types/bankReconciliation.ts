// Types for the Bank Reconciliation surface. Mirrors the JSON returned by the
// `/api/bank-reconciliation` endpoints (the Pydantic contract in
// `backend/app/schemas/bank_reconciliation.py`). Date fields are ISO strings
// (or null); money fields are `MoneyAmount`, never `number`.
//
// PII discipline mirrors the backend: `account_identifier` is whatever the
// importer typed to name the account (a nickname or a masked tail) — the full
// account / routing numbers never leave the bank's own file, and nothing here
// carries one. Nothing in this module widens what the API already exposes.
//
// Not entity-scoped: `BankStatement` / `BankTransaction` predate multi-entity
// and cover an org-wide bank account, so there is no entity filter here.

/**
 * What a reviewer is actually looking at on one transaction row.
 *
 * Derived rather than stored, because the API answers the question across
 * four fields (`direction`, `matched_payment_id`, `match_method`,
 * `match_confidence`) and a row that renders only one of them tells a
 * half-truth. In particular a 50–70 fuzzy vendor-name hit is a *suggestion* a
 * human still owes a decision on — rendering it the same green as a reference
 * match would be the UI asserting a fact the matcher never claimed.
 *
 *  - `credit`       — not a payment we made; the matcher skips these entirely.
 *  - `unmatched`    — a debit with no payment behind it (money left the
 *                     account we have no record of authorising).
 *  - `discrepancy`  — linked to a payment, but it does not reconcile.
 *  - `confirmed`    — certain identity: an exact reference hit, or a human's
 *                     own resolve (both land at confidence 100).
 *  - `probable`     — a single amount + date candidate in the window (80–99).
 *  - `suggested`    — vendor-name similarity only (50–79), or a linked row
 *                     carrying no confidence at all. Needs a human.
