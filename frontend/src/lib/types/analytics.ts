// Response shapes for the predictive cash-flow forecasting endpoints
// (backend/app/api/analytics.py). Hand-maintained — the project has no
// codegen, mirroring src/lib/types/invoice.ts.
//
// Money on the `/api/analytics/*` endpoints is `MoneyString` — an EXACT
// decimal string, never a JSON number — so no currency figure round-trips
// through a binary float.
//
// The `GET /api/dashboard` block at the bottom of this file is the exception,
// and the difference is the WIRE, not a preference: those schemas annotate
// their amounts `backend/app/schemas/money.py::MoneyAmount`, which serialises
// `Decimal` to a JSON *number*. Typing those `MoneyString` would be a
// different lie, so they are `MoneyAmount` (`string | number | null`) — honest
// about both shapes, and still enough to make raw arithmetic a type error.
// See `frontend/CLAUDE.md` § Money formatting.
//
// Either way: render with `<Money>` / `formatMoney`; the only sanctioned way
// to get a number out of one is `parseMoneyForLayout` (chart geometry +
// ordering only). A day count, a percentage and a row count are genuinely
// numbers and stay `number`.
