// Types for the Procurement → Budgets surface. Mirrors the JSON returned by the
// `/api/budgets` endpoints (backend `BudgetResponse` / `BudgetSpendResponse` /
// `BudgetCheckResponse`). Date/datetime fields are ISO strings.
//
// **Money fields are `MoneyAmount`, never `number`.** The backend serialises
// these rollups as JSON numbers (`schemas/budget.py` does `float(...)` on the
// way out), so `MoneyString` would be a different lie — but a `number` field
// invites `a - b`, `Math.max()` and `.toFixed()` on currency, which is the
// arithmetic the Decimal invariant exists to prevent. `MoneyAmount` is honest
// about the wire shape AND makes that arithmetic a type error; where a figure
// legitimately has to become a number, `parseMoneyForLayout` (geometry) and
// `isPositiveAmount` / `isNegativeAmount` (predicates) are the only routes.
// See `frontend/CLAUDE.md` § Money formatting.
//
// The `total` on the list/summary envelopes is deliberately still `number`:
// it is a ROW COUNT, not an allocation. The per-currency allocation totals live
// on `BudgetSummary.by_currency`.
