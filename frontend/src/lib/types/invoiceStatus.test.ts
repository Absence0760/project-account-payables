 * Drift guard for the invoice-status LABELS, the sibling of

 *
 * `Record<InvoiceStatus, MessageKey>` already fails `pnpm check` when a status
 * is added with no key — but a key naming nothing in the catalogue typechecks
 * fine and renders the raw key string (`m()` falls back key → raw), which is
 * how `invoices.status.readyForReview` would reach a badge as literal text.
 * This is the runtime half.
