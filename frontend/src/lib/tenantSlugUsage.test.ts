// Regression coverage for issue #170: two call sites hand-rolled
// `document.location.hostname.split('.')[0]` for the X-Tenant-Slug header on
// a raw-fetch binary-download path (bypassing $lib/api.ts by necessity — a
// blob download needs the raw Response). That duplicated getTenantSlug()'s
// logic without its bare-apex-domain guard, so a deployed apex hostname with
// no tenant subdomain would send the apex's first label as a bogus tenant
// slug instead of no header at all. These are pure source-text assertions
// (not component tests — the frontend's vitest setup targets pure modules
// only, per frontend/CLAUDE.md) proving neither site re-derives the subdomain.
//
// The invariant is "never re-derive the slug", not "call getTenantSlug here":
// a site that has since moved onto the shared client (`api.downloadBlob`,
// which sets Authorization + X-Tenant-Slug + X-Entity-ID centrally) satisfies
// it without touching the header at all, and is strictly better than the
// hand-built version this test was originally written against. So the
// getTenantSlug requirement applies only to a file that still builds the
// header itself.
//
// It matters more now than it did for #170. A hand-rolled `hostname.split()`
// no longer just skips the apex guard — it can't tell a platform subdomain
// from a customer's white-label VANITY host, and on a vanity host the correct
// header is *no header at all* (a present one suppresses the backend's
// `Host`-based tenant lookup). See `$lib/hostRouting.ts`.

/**
 * Files still reading the build-time `PUBLIC_API_URL` directly instead of
 * `$lib/tenant.ts::getApiBase()`.
 *
 * `getApiBase()` resolves the API origin from the CURRENT host — the build-time
 * URL on a platform host, same-origin on a customer's vanity domain (only a
 * same-origin request carries the vanity hostname in `Host`, which is what the
 * backend resolves the tenant from). A file that keeps its own
 * `PUBLIC_API_URL.replace(/\/+$/, '')` sends its requests to the platform's own
 * API origin on every host, so it silently opts out of custom-domain support.
 *
 * **Only ever remove an entry — never add one.** Each remaining file needs the
 * same one-line swap the shared clients got; they are listed here rather than
 * left invisible.
 *
 * The list is now EMPTY, and that is the point of the ratchet: the last entry
 * was `routes/login/+page.svelte`, whose full-page navigations to the SSO /
 * SAML authorize endpoints could not move off the build-time origin while
 * those routes took the tenant as a REQUIRED `?slug=` a vanity host does not
 * have. That is fixed backend-side — `?slug=` is optional and an absent one is
 * resolved from the request `Host` against the tenant's registered custom
 * domains — so the login page now uses `getApiBase()` and omits the param.
