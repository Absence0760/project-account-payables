/**
 * Tenant + API-origin resolution for the current host.
 *
 * This module is the ONLY place that reads the host-routing configuration; the
 * rules themselves are dependency-free in `$lib/hostRouting.ts` (and unit-tested
 * there, via `tenant.test.ts`). Everything below is the same one-line
 * composition, so the two can't drift and no call site re-derives a slug or an
 * API origin of its own.
 *
 * Configuration: `PUBLIC_PLATFORM_DOMAINS` — a comma-separated list of the
 * registrable domains the PLATFORM serves (e.g. `feohledger.com,localhost`).
 * Read through `$env/dynamic/public` rather than `$env/static/public` on
 * purpose: a `$env/static/public` import of an unset variable is a hard build
 * error, and every existing build (CI, `deploy/deploy.sh`, GitHub Pages) sets
 * only `PUBLIC_API_URL`. Unset therefore has to be legal, and it means
 * "replay the pre-change rule" — see `$lib/hostRouting.ts`.
