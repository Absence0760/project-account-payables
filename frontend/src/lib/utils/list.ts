/**
 * Locale-aware list joining.
 *
 * The third `Intl`-backed formatter in this directory, alongside
 * `money.ts::formatMoney` and `time.ts`'s date / relative-time helpers, and it
 * reads the same active-locale holder (`i18n/formatLocale`) they do — so the
 * locale picker moves the separators inside an enumeration at the same moment
 * it moves decimal separators and month names.
 *
 * ## Why a helper rather than `.join(', ')`
 *
 * `', '` is an English punctuation rule wearing a string literal's clothes.
 * Japanese separates list items with the ideographic comma `、` and no space;
 * German and Spanish join the final pair with a word (`und` / `y`) rather than
 * a comma. A translated sentence with an ASCII-comma list spliced into it
 * therefore reads as half-localized in three of the six shipped locales — and
 * the mismatch is loudest exactly where it matters most: inside a
 * screen-reader announcement, where the separator is what produces the pause
 * between items.
 *
 * ## What it does NOT cover
 *
 * Only lists a HUMAN READS AS PROSE. A `.join(', ')` whose output is parsed
 * back (a text input re-split on `,`), sent over the wire (a query parameter,
 * a CSV cell), or which is a bare list of machine identifiers (role slugs, API
 * scopes, webhook event types) must keep its literal separator: swapping in a
 * locale-dependent one there is a correctness bug, not a translation fix.
 *
 * Pure — no `$state`, no `fetch`, no Svelte compiler — so it unit-tests under
 * the plain-Node vitest config exactly like `money.ts` and `time.ts`.

/**
 * How a list reads once joined.
 *
 * - `plain` — an enumeration with no connecting word in English. This is the
 *   drop-in replacement for `.join(', ')`: `conjunction` at `narrow` width
 *   renders `"A, B, C"` in en / fr / pt-BR (character-identical to the literal
 *   it replaces), `"A、B、C"` in ja, and `"A, B und C"` / `"A, B y C"` in
 *   de / es — which is what those languages actually do with a list. `unit` was
 *   rejected as the plain shape: its Japanese form is SPACE-separated
 *   (`"A B C"`) and drops the comma entirely, the opposite of the fix.
 * - `and` — an explicit conjunction (`"A, B, and C"`).
 * - `or` — an explicit disjunction (`"A, B, or C"`).
