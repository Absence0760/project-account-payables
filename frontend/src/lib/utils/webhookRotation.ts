// Pure helpers for the outbound-webhook signing-secret rotation UI
// (`/admin/webhooks`). No Svelte, no `api` — so the rules can be unit-tested
// (`webhookRotation.test.ts`) without a browser or a backend.
//
// Backend contract: `POST /api/webhooks/{id}/rotate-secret` with an optional
// `{overlap_minutes}`. During the overlap window the retiring secret keeps
// signing a second `X-Webhook-Signature-Previous` header, so a receiver that
// accepts either header rotates with zero dropped deliveries. The bounds below
// mirror `backend/app/services/webhooks/rotation.py` — the backend refuses an
// out-of-range value with a 422 rather than clamping it (silently shortening a
// window drops deliveries the caller relied on; silently lengthening one keeps
// a key they wanted dead alive), so the picker must only ever offer values the
// backend accepts. See `backend/docs/public-api.md` § Rotating a signing secret.
