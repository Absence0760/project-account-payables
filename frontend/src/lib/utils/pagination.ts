/**
 * Load-more append for offset-paginated lists.
 *
 * Append the next page onto the already-loaded rows, skipping any id already
 * present. Offset pagination can re-surface a row when the underlying set
 * shifts between fetches (e.g. a new invoice inserted, a notification arriving
 * between page loads); a duplicate id would crash the keyed
 * `{#each ... (item.id)}` rendering the list (Svelte 5 `each_key_duplicate`).
 *
 * Semantics (matching the original invoice-store inline guard):
 * - The existing row wins — an incoming duplicate is dropped, never replacing
 *   the already-rendered row.
 * - Order is preserved: existing rows first (in order), then the incoming
 *   page's new rows in their server order.

 * checkbox only ever selects the currently-LOADED page of rows (the bulk
 * endpoints take an explicit id list, and the page only has what it fetched
 * client-side) — this is the whole filtered set instead, resolved
 * server-side so a bulk action can't silently skip rows past the first page.
 * `truncated` is true when the match count exceeded the server's cap
 * (`MAX_SELECT_ALL_IDS`), so a partial selection is never presented as
 * complete.
