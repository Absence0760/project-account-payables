/**
 * Which currency an optimizer recommendation's money is denominated in.
 *
 * `POST /api/discounts/optimize` returns three money TOTALS in one stated
 * `currency` (the org's reporting currency) plus a ranked list of
 * recommendations. Each recommendation's `roi.savings` is computed from its own
 * OFFER's `base_amount`, so it is in the OFFER's currency — equal to the
 * totals' currency only when the row is not flagged `unconvertible`.
 *
 * Each row now STATES its currency (`OptimizerRecommendation.currency`), so
 * that is what a figure is labelled with, flag or no flag. `unconvertible`
 * keeps its own separate job: it says this row's money is not in the totals'
 * currency and therefore is not counted in them, which the card reports as a
 * marker beside the (correctly labelled) figure.
 *
 * The resolution order matters, and both rungs are real:
 *
 *   1. the row's own `currency` — authoritative, whatever the flag says;
 *   2. no `currency` on the row (a response predating the field): fall back to
 *      `unconvertible === false` ⇒ the offer's currency PROVABLY equals the
 *      response's `currency`; `unconvertible === true` ⇒ the offer is in some
 *      OTHER currency the payload does not name, so there is no honest code to
 *      stamp on it and the caller renders the figure bare.
 *
 * The page used to label every card with the ORG default currency read from a
 * separate store, which is right for the convertible rows by coincidence and
 * wrong for exactly the rows the flag marks: a €412 saving rendered as
 * "Save $412.00", two lines below a banner saying those offers are in another
 * currency.
 *
 * Pure — no `$state`, no `fetch` — so it sits in `utils/` beside
 * `discountPartialSet.ts` and is unit-tested under the plain-Node vitest config.
