/**
 * Source-scan guard: a literal `.join(', ')` over PROSE must go through
 * `utils/list.ts::formatList`.
 *
 * `', '` is English punctuation. Japanese enumerates with the ideographic
 * comma `、`; German and Spanish join the final pair with a word. A translated
 * sentence with an ASCII-comma list spliced into it is half-localized in three
 * of the six shipped locales, and the seam is loudest in a screen-reader
 * announcement, where the separator is the pause.
 *
 * But the literal is CORRECT in the other half of the tree, and swapping it for
 * a locale-dependent separator there would be a bug rather than a translation
 * fix. So this guard does not ban the literal — it pins the exhaustive list of
 * places that keep it, each with the reason it does. A new `.join(', ')` fails
 * here until someone classifies it: prose goes through `formatList`, everything
 * else joins the table below with a one-line justification.
 *
 * Textual and deliberately blunt, mirroring `storeLoadRejection.test.ts` and
 * `effectTimerCleanup.test.ts` (and the backend's own source-scan drift guards
 * in `tests/test_payment_methods.py`). It reads the tree through Vite's
 * `import.meta.glob` for the same reason `a11y/tokenPairing.test.ts` does — the
 * frontend deliberately carries no `@types/node`.

/**
 * Every component that keeps a literal `', '` join, mapped to how many it has
 * and why it is not prose.
 *
 * Three families, and the distinction is what the joined string is FOR:
 *
 *  1. **Round-tripped through an input.** The value is rendered into a text
 *     field and re-parsed by splitting on `,`. A locale separator would make
 *     the field un-round-trippable — type in Japanese, save, and the whole list
 *     collapses to one entry.
 *  2. **A bare list of machine identifiers in a table cell.** Role slugs, API
 *     scopes, webhook event types, audit-log field names, email addresses.
 *     These are codes a reader copies, not a sentence they read, and the ASCII
 *     comma is part of that convention.
 *  3. **Backend-generated English not yet routed through `m()`.** Localizing
 *     the punctuation of a sentence whose words are still hardcoded English
 *     would be a half-fix; the durable fix is extracting the copy, and these
 *     move to `formatList` in the same change.
