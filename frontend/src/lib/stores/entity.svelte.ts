/**
 * Multi-entity (subsidiary) selector store — backs the sidebar entity
 * switcher. Loads the tenant's entities (`GET /api/entities`) and tracks the
 * current selection (a UUID, or {@link ALL_ENTITIES} for the consolidated
 * view). The selection persists via `$lib/entity` (tenant-scoped localStorage);
 * `api.ts` reads it on every request to set `X-Entity-ID`.
 *
 * Switching entity calls {@link select}, which persists the choice and reloads
 * the page so every store/page re-fetches scoped data — pages fetch in their
 * own `$effect`/`onMount`, not in SvelteKit `load`, so a hard reload is the
 * simplest correct way to re-scope the whole app at once.
 *
 * The switcher only renders when the tenant has more than one entity, so a
 * single-entity tenant sees exactly the pre-multi-entity UI.
 *
 * The list is loaded WHOLE (active and inactive alike) because two readers
 * need the archived rows — `/admin/entities` reactivates them, and this store
 * has to be able to name the entity behind a stored selection that has since
 * been retired. What must never include them is the *selection* surface: see
 * {@link EntityStore.activeEntities} and {@link EntityStore.deactivatedSelection}.

	 * they didn't; consolidated says exactly what is true — no entity is
