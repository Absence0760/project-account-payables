/**
 * Source-scan guard: `/vendors/screening` carries no hardcoded user-facing
 * English.
 *
 * Round 28 keyed this route's shared label MAPS (screening status, risk level,
 * hit category) and left the page's own copy in place, so a German or Japanese
 * reviewer got translated pills sitting inside an English page — and the
 * strings that matter most here are the ones on the two controls that stop a
 * payment (Block / Re-screen) and the three history states, where "we could
 * not look" must not read as "there is nothing to see".
 *
 * Two halves, because each catches what the other cannot:
 *
 *  1. The exact literals the extraction removed. Cheap, exhaustive for what
 *     shipped, and a revert fails loudly rather than silently.
 *  2. A forward rule — every user-facing ATTRIBUTE must be an expression, not a
 *     quoted literal — which catches copy nobody has written yet.
 *
 * It reads the file through Vite's `import.meta.glob` for the same reason
 * `lib/a11y/tokenPairing.test.ts` does: the frontend deliberately carries no
 * `@types/node`, so there is no `fs`.
