 * `services/cashflow.py::resolve_opening_balance` refused it, falling through
 * to the persisted figure (or zero). Without a distinct notice that state is
 * indistinguishable on the page from "no bank is connected" — same number, same
 * silence — and the two have different remedies: one is "connect a bank", the
 * other is "your bank IS connected, in the wrong currency".
 *
 * Route-local because it is one page's presentation rule, not a shared helper;
 * pure so the fallback below can be pinned without driving a browser.
