# UI patterns and design system

The full pattern library for the SvelteKit app — page layout, `DataTable`,
sortable headers, `SearchBox`, `BulkBar`, pagination, the request sequencer,
status-filter chips, modals, per-row actions, clickable rows, class-name
conventions, accessibility patterns and the colour tokens.

Extracted from `frontend/CLAUDE.md` so that file stays small enough to load
cheaply into every conversation that touches the frontend. **Read the relevant
section here before building or restyling a page** — guard rail 9 (reusable
components) is enforced against these patterns, and the accessibility and colour
sections carry WCAG 2.2 AA obligations that regression tests in
`frontend/tests-e2e/a11y/` will fail you on.


Reuse these patterns instead of inventing new ones. Reach for the
existing component first; only deviate with a written justification.

### Page layout

Wrap every authenticated route in **`<PageHeader title="…">`**
(`$lib/components/ui/PageHeader.svelte`) — it renders the `.workspace`
shell, the `.toolbar` header with the `<h1>` title, and an optional
`{#snippet actions()}` for right-aligned primary actions (e.g.
`+ Invite User`, `+ Upload Invoices`). The page body goes in `children`.
Don't hand-roll `<div class="workspace"><header class="toolbar">` any
more. The shell still produces this layout:

```css
.workspace {
    max-width: 1800px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    padding: 24px 20px;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    gap: 16px;
    min-height: 100vh;
}
```

This is what produces the consistent left/right gap between sidebar
and content across pages — do not change `max-width` or `padding`
per-route. A new route must use these exact values. The 1800px cap
is wide enough for grid pages on 1920–2560px monitors without leaving
half the viewport empty; on a 13″ laptop the natural body width
constrains it before the cap kicks in.

### Data tables (`DataTable`)

Use **`<DataTable>`** (`$lib/components/ui/DataTable.svelte`) for every
grid page instead of hand-rolling `<div class="grid-container"><table>`:

```svelte
<DataTable columns={COLUMNS} isEmpty={items.length === 0} empty="No items.">
    {#snippet body()}
        {#each items as item (item.id)}
            <tr class:row-selected={selected.has(item.id)}>
                <td>…</td>
                <td class="actions"><RowAction …>Edit</RowAction></td>
            </tr>
        {/each}
    {/snippet}
</DataTable>
```

- `columns = [{label?, class?}]` builds the `<thead>`. For a select-all
  checkbox or sortable headers, pass `{#snippet header()}<tr>…</tr>{/snippet}`
  + `colspan={N}` instead of `columns`.
- The `body` snippet renders the rows; the page keeps full control of
  `<tr>`/`<td>` markup + classes (so bespoke cell styling stays page-scoped).
- `isEmpty` + `empty` render the centred `td.empty` row, tagged
  `data-testid="table-empty"` so e2e specs can assert *which* empty state is
  showing.
- **`empty` must distinguish loading / errored / genuinely-empty.** A list that
  renders its "nothing here" copy while a fetch is in flight — or forever after
  a failed one — is asserting something it never established. Compose it:
  `empty={loading ? m('common.loading') : errored ? m('…empty.errored') : normalEmpty}`,
  and set both flags in the fetch's `try`/`catch`/`finally`. `/notifications`,
  `/exceptions` and the dashboard are the reference implementations; on
  `/exceptions` in particular the empty copy ("Everything looks good!") is a
  claim about open fraud flags and compliance holds, so getting this wrong is a
  correctness bug, not a polish one. **When the fetch lives in a store, the
  store owns the flag** — `invoiceStore` / `paymentStore` / `contractStore` /
  `expenseStore` each expose `errored`, set in the loader's `catch` under
  `isCurrentRequest` (the same rule the `loading` flag uses) and cleared on the
  next success. The loader still **re-throws**, so a caller that awaits a
  refresh keeps its own handling (`/invoices`' post-upload "Uploaded, but the
  list could not be refreshed" toast is exactly that, and
  `tests-e2e/invoices/upload-refetch-failure.spec.ts` guards it).
  `tests-e2e/reactivity/list-load-failure.spec.ts` stubs a 500 on all four
  lists and asserts the error copy, not the "nothing matched" copy.
- Opt-in `fixed` (`table-layout: fixed`, pair with `<th>` widths) and
  `stickyHeader`. These two MUST be props (they target DataTable-owned
  `<table>`/`<thead>`, which a page-scoped selector can't reach).

### Column sort (`SortableHeader`)

`$lib/components/ui/SortableHeader.svelte` renders one clickable, sortable
`<th>` for use inside a `DataTable`'s `header` snippet (see the note in
*Data tables* above). Pairs with the pure `$lib/utils/sort.ts::toggleSort`
helper — click an inactive column to sort it ascending, click the active
one again to flip direction:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
    import SortableHeader from '$lib/components/ui/SortableHeader.svelte';
    import { toggleSort, type SortOrder } from '$lib/utils/sort';

    let sortField = $state<string | null>($page.url.searchParams.get('sort'));
    let sortOrder = $state<SortOrder>(($page.url.searchParams.get('order') as SortOrder) ?? 'desc');

    function handleSort(field: string) {
        const next = toggleSort({ field: sortField, order: sortOrder }, field);
        sortField = next.field;
        sortOrder = next.order;
        syncUrl(); // fold sort into the page's existing URL sync, or a dedicated syncSortUrl()
        store.fetch(buildParams());
    }
</script>

<SortableHeader field="amount" label={m('…col.amount')} active={sortField === 'amount'} order={sortOrder} onsort={handleSort} />
```

- The backend validates `sort=` against a per-endpoint allowlist
  (`backend/app/api/sorting.py`) — an out-of-list value is a 422, so only
  pass field keys the endpoint actually declares.
- `null` field = the backend's own default order; only send `sort`/`order`
  in `buildParams()` when `sortField` is set (`untrack()` the read the same
  way `search` is — `buildParams()` is called from filter effects too).
- Persist the choice to the URL the same way the page's other filter state
  is persisted (mirror `/expenses`' `syncUrl()`, or a page-local
  `syncSortUrl()` when the page has no existing filter→URL sync).
- Shipped on `/invoices`, `/vendors`, `/payments` (History tab), `/expenses`,
  and `/contracts` — the five primary list pages.

### Search (`SearchBox`)

Pill-shaped search input with a magnifier-glass SVG. Single component:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
    import SearchBox from '$lib/components/ui/SearchBox.svelte';
    let search = $state('');
</script>

<SearchBox
    bind:value={search}
    placeholder="Search invoices..."
    ariaLabel="Search invoices"
/>
```

- Debounce search before fetching (250–300ms is the convention; see
  `routes/admin/+page.svelte` and `routes/invoices/+page.svelte`).
- Server-side filter via `?search=` param. Backend uses ILIKE on the
  most natural fields for that entity (e.g. name + email, or
  invoice_number + vendor_name).
- Clearing the input must re-fire the request without `?search=`,
  not just visually clear.
- **Never filter the loaded rows instead.** A client-side `.filter()` over
  what the page has already fetched silently hides every match living on a
  later page — the user searches and is told nothing matched. `/expenses` and
  `/requisitions` both shipped that way and needed an honest "searched only
  the N rows loaded so far" empty state to avoid lying; the fix was the
  backend `search` leg, not better copy. If the endpoint has no `search`
  parameter yet, add it — don't approximate it in the browser.
- **A term that hits the network needs the same discipline as a chip**:
  debounce, the page/store `createRequestSequencer` (see below), and a record
  of the term the newest issued request carried. The two pages above keep an
  `appliedSearch` `$state`, written where the request is issued and read by
  the debounce effect, which schedules nothing when the term already matches
  it. That is what stops the effect's FIRST run (mount, including a
  bookmarked `?search=`) firing a duplicate load 300ms behind the status
  effect's — and it cancels a pending debounce when a chip click has already
  loaded with the typed term.
- **Read `search` via `untrack(() => search)` inside the loader / params
  builder.** Any function the status-filter `$effect` calls *synchronously* is
  still inside that effect's tracking scope — Svelte registers reads
  transitively — so a plain read there makes the status effect depend on the
  term and every keystroke fires its own immediate request. `untrack` still
  reads the live value; it only stops the read becoming a dependency. This is
  issue #168, and it has now been reintroduced twice through a *different*
  function than the one previously fixed (`syncUrl` first, then the loader),
  so treat it as a property of the call site, not of one function:
  `routes/vendors/+page.svelte` is the reference. A `fill()`-based e2e cannot
  catch it — one state write, one term, and it passes either way. Guard it by
  typing: `pressSequentially` inside the debounce window, assert nothing
  fired, then exactly one request for the final term
  (`tests-e2e/{requisitions,expenses}/search-scope.spec.ts`, and the
  parameterized `tests-e2e/reactivity/search-debounce-race.spec.ts`).
- Do NOT re-implement the search-box markup inline. If you find
  yourself writing `<svg ...><circle .../><path .../></svg>` next to
  an `<input>`, you are diverging from the pattern.

### Bulk selection (`BulkBar` + `BulkDeleteButton`)

Floating, fixed-position bar at the bottom of the viewport that
appears when one or more rows are selected:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
    import BulkBar from '$lib/components/ui/BulkBar.svelte';
    import BulkDeleteButton from '$lib/components/ui/BulkDeleteButton.svelte';

    let selected = $state<Set<string>>(new Set());
</script>

<BulkBar count={selected.size} onclear={() => (selected = new Set())}>
    {#snippet actions()}
        <BulkDeleteButton
            onconfirm={handleBulkDelete}
            disabled={busy}
            label={`Delete ${selected.size}`}
        />
        <!-- additional .bulk-action-btn buttons go here -->
    {/snippet}
</BulkBar>
```

**Required behaviours:**
- Selection lives in a `Set<string>` keyed by row id.
- Header checkbox toggles select-all over the *selectable* subset
  (e.g. excluding the current user, the default workflow, or
  immutable-status invoices). Items that can't be selected render
  their `<td class="checkbox-col">` empty rather than disabled.
- Delete is always armed-confirm (one click arms; outside-click or
  second click un-arms or commits). `BulkDeleteButton` does this.
- Bulk endpoints return a partial-success shape — `{deleted: [],
  failed: [{id, reason, ...}]}` — and the page surfaces the per-row
  reason in a toast. See `bulk_delete_users` in `backend/app/api/admin.py`
  for the canonical contract.

**The one exception:** `/payments` queue uses a non-floating
`<div class="pay-bar">` because it's a payment-run *builder*
(selection drives the next step's UI, not row actions). Don't copy
this pattern elsewhere. Its "select all N matching" resolves the whole
selectable set via `GET /api/payments/queue/ids` (which also returns a
per-currency money breakdown, so the pay-bar's subtotals + mixed-currency
guard stay honest without holding every row); while in matching mode the
prune effect is skipped and the money totals come from that backend
breakdown, not the loaded page — mirrors `/invoices`' `selectedAllMatching`.

Shipped on `/invoices`, `/expenses`, `/vendors` (bulk verify/reject via
`POST /api/vendors/bulk/status`, bulk re-screen via `.../bulk/screen`, CSV
export via `.../bulk/export`; gated to `vendor.manage`) and `/contracts`
(bulk activate/terminate/cancel via `POST /api/contracts/bulk/status`,
routed through the same `_transition` helper the single-row lifecycle
buttons use; CSV export) and the `/payments` **Queue** tab (payment-run
builder, `GET /api/payments/queue/ids`) — the "select all N matching"
affordance on each resolves the whole filtered set via that resource's
`GET .../ids` sibling endpoint (`getVendorIds`/`getContractIds`/`getExpenseIds`)
rather than only the currently-loaded page.

### Pagination + Load more

Default page size is **20** across all list endpoints. Backend
returns `{items, total, page, page_size}`; the front-end renders the
items, then a centred Load More button below the table:

```svelte
{#if store.hasMore}
    <div class="load-more-row">
        <button class="btn-load-more" onclick={loadMore} disabled={store.loading}>
            {store.loading ? 'Loading…' : `Load more (${store.items.length} of ${store.total})`}
        </button>
    </div>
{:else if store.total > 0}
    <div class="load-more-row">
        <span class="load-more-end">Showing all {store.total} <thing>s</span>
    </div>
{/if}
```

- Append, don't replace. `loadMore` issues `page=N+1` and appends the new
  items **via `appendUnique` (`$lib/utils/pagination.ts`)** — never a raw
  `[...existing, ...res.items]` spread. Offset pagination can re-surface a
  row when the underlying set shifts between fetches (a new row inserted, a
  notification arriving), and a duplicated id crashes the keyed
  `{#each ... (id)}` with Svelte 5's `each_key_duplicate`. `appendUnique`
  drops incoming duplicates (existing row wins, order preserved); every
  load-more site — the list stores and the inline route/component loaders —
  uses it.
- "Showing all N" is the empty-string-of-pagination state — confirms
  for the user that they've reached the end. It is **only ever rendered
  behind `{:else if total > 0}`**, never on its own: `total` is the
  server's count of the whole filtered set, so a list that asks for one
  capped page and then states "Showing all {total}" is asserting that
  rows it never fetched do not exist. Six lists (budgets, intake,
  catalogs, requisitions, and the `/expenses` Reports + Cards sub-lists)
  shipped that way — 50 rows under a footer reading "Showing all 87",
  with no control to reach the other 37. `src/lib/utils/pagedListFooter.test.ts`
  is the guard: any file referencing a `<list>.showingAll` message must
  also reference the matching `<list>.loadMore`.
- Stores expose `total`, `page`, `hasMore`, and any mutating actions
  (create / delete / bulk-delete) keep `total` in sync without a
  refetch.

### Sequencing list fetches (`createRequestSequencer`)

Every list surface that can have a request in flight while something else
changes the list wires **`createRequestSequencer()`**
(`$lib/utils/requestSequence.ts`). This is now the whole app, not a handful of
pages: the list stores (`invoices`, `payments`, `contracts`, `expenses`,
`notifications`, `admin`, `workflows`), the list routes (`vendors`,
`vendors/screening`, `discounts`, `positive-pay`, `recurring`, `budgets`,
`intake`, `requisitions`, `catalogs`, `vendor-statements`, the four sub-lists
on `expenses`, the `workflows/[id]` builder canvas), the **detail-modal /
drill-down fetches** that a second click can re-issue (`/goods-receipts`'
receipt detail + its inspections — the reference implementation;
`/vendors/screening`'s screening-history timeline; `/audit`'s per-invoice
signature drill-down; `/admin/api-keys`' per-key usage; `/experiments`' results
readout), `InvoiceModal`'s line-item editor, and the three **analytics** surfaces whose loads are keyed
off a control rather than a filter — `/cfo` (its `$effect` fired three
unsequenced requests per keystroke on the two free-text money inputs, so the
cash-position curve and the "below minimum balance" breach banner could settle
on the figures for a *prefix* of what the field showed), `CfoMetrics` (the
30/90/180/365 horizon buttons) and `/tax` (the 1099 year selector). **A new
list surface wires it too** — don't hand-roll a second mechanism, and don't
leave it out because the page "only" edits a row after the first load has
landed (see the create/prepend note below). "Not a list" is not an exemption
either: any state written from a response that a control can re-issue needs
it, and a free-text control needs the debounce beside it (issue #168 /
`docs/decisions.md` §53 — anything an effect calls synchronously is inside its
tracking scope, so `load()` must `untrack` the free-text reads).

It answers two separate questions about a response — and takes one call that
retires in-flight requests. Conflating the two questions is a bug both ways:

```ts
const fetchSequence = createRequestSequencer();

async function fetch(params) {
    const token = fetchSequence.start();   // synchronously, before firing
    loading = true;
    try {
        const res = await api.get(`/api/things?${qs}`);
        if (!fetchSequence.canCommit(token)) return;   // stale → discard
        things = res.items;
    } finally {
        // NOT canCommit — see below.
        if (fetchSequence.isCurrentRequest(token)) loading = false;
    }
}
```

- **`canCommit(token)`** — may this response be written into state? False
  once a later `start()` has happened (the classic "search `acm` resolves
  after `acme`" race) **or** once a local edit superseded it.
- **`isCurrentRequest(token)`** — is this still the newest request I
  issued? Use it in the `finally` for the `loading` flag and for any
  load-error toast. Reading `canCommit` there leaves the spinner stuck on
  forever after a local edit, because no newer request exists to clear it.
- **`wasSupersededByEdit(token)`** — did a *local edit* retire this request?
  The third question, and only a **write** asks it. A save that PUTs the list
  and then re-reads it takes a token too, but its post-condition is narrower
  than a read's: only an edit invalidates what it sent. Reading `canCommit`
  there makes an unrelated newer read look like a conflict — which is how
  `InvoiceModal.saveLineItems` first shipped, leaving its dirty flag (and so
  the Save button) stuck on whenever an extraction poll's own reload landed
  mid-save.
- **`supersedeInFlight()`** — call it **immediately before** any helper
  that edits the list in place with no fetch of its own
  (`invoiceStore.update` / `patchLocal`, the vendors page's
  `applyVendorUpdate`). Without it the counter never moves, so an
  already-in-flight fetch resolves afterwards holding a pre-edit snapshot
  and silently reverts the edit — a user watching their approve, or the
  payment block they just lifted, undo itself. Requests issued *after* the
  edit are unaffected; they read server state that already includes it.

The superseded response is discarded, never merged — see
`docs/decisions.md` §23 for why re-applying the edit on top of it isn't
sound. A store with no local-mutation helper (every mutation re-fetches
through the sequencer, like `paymentStore`) needs no `supersedeInFlight`
call; say so in a comment rather than leaving the next reader to derive it.

Three things the sweep across the app settled, worth not re-deriving:

- **A create/prepend path needs no existing row.** "The mount fetch must have
  landed before there's a row to mutate" closes the race for edit and delete
  but *not* for New/Add, which is live while the first GET is still out. Every
  `upsert()` that can prepend an unseen row — `createUser`, `createFromTemplate`,
  a generated Positive Pay file — supersedes for that reason alone.
- **One sequencer per independent list, never one shared counter.** A page or
  store holding several lists (the `admin` store's users vs roles, the
  `notifications` store's list vs its 60s unread-count poll, `expenses`' four
  tabs, `discounts`' offers vs KPI dashboard) gives each its own. Sharing one
  would let an unrelated request mark another list's in-flight response
  un-committable and blank it. A local edit that writes state BOTH lists load
  (a mark-read, which moves `unread`) supersedes both.
- **A detail modal is a list of one, and it is the dangerous case.** "Open A,
  close it, open B" re-issues the same request with a different subject, so an
  unguarded fetch renders A's data under B's name — indistinguishably, because
  the heading comes from the click and the body from the response. Every such
  fetch takes its own sequencer, and the panel carries BOTH ids in the DOM (the
  subject it was opened for, and the id the response claims) so a mismatch is
  assertable rather than inferred: `verify-drill`'s `data-invoice-id` /
  `data-report-for`, `experiment-results`' `data-experiment-id` /
  `data-results-for`, `api-key-usage`'s `data-key-id` / `data-usage-for`,
  `screening-history`'s `data-vendor-id`. On
  `/vendors/screening` this was not cosmetic — the modal also **acts**
  (Block/Unblock payments), so a reviewer read vendor A's sanctions timeline
  while the control blocked vendor B. Its actions now capture the vendor at
  click time and everything after the first await reads that capture, never the
  live `selected`; `busy` is keyed to that vendor too, so an action on one
  vendor can't disable another's controls. Guards:
  `tests-e2e/vendors/screening-modal-identity.spec.ts`,
  `tests-e2e/audit/signature-drill-identity.spec.ts`,
  `tests-e2e/experiments/results-identity.spec.ts`, and the usage-identity case
  in `tests-e2e/admin/api-keys.spec.ts` — each drives the race with a held
  response released by hand, never a sleep.
- **An editor over a fetched list is the same surface.** The `workflows/[id]`
  canvas and `InvoiceModal`'s line-item table hold unsaved user edits, so a
  load resolving mid-edit doesn't just revert a row — it wipes work while the
  dirty flag stays set on something the user can no longer see. Both route
  every edit through a `markDirty()` that supersedes first.

**Related, and the other half of the same bug:** a filter `$effect` that calls
a `buildParams()` / `syncUrl()` helper reading `search` ends up depending on
`search` (Svelte tracks reads transitively through called functions), so every
keystroke fires an immediate un-debounced load *alongside* the debounced one.
Read `search` via `untrack(() => search)` in the params-builder, and untrack
`syncUrl()` wholesale — it is a writer of URL state, never a dependency
source. `tests-e2e/reactivity/search-debounce-race.spec.ts` is the guard.

**A debounce `$effect` must return its own teardown.** A `$effect` that arms a
timer and returns nothing leaves it armed when the component is destroyed, so
the callback runs against a page the user already left: `syncUrl()` rewrites
the address bar (SvelteKit's `replaceState` doesn't care which route is
mounted), and a list-store reload writes a pre-navigation snapshot into a
module-level store the *next* page shares. Always close the effect with

```ts
return () => clearTimeout(searchTimer);
```

Svelte also runs that teardown before each re-run, so it subsumes the
`clearTimeout` at the top of the body rather than fighting it. Enforced across
the tree by `src/lib/utils/effectTimerCleanup.test.ts`, a source scan that
fails any `$effect` body containing `setTimeout(` / `setInterval(` without a
matching `return () => clear…` — a deliberate static guard, because the
symptom only shows inside a sub-second window that no non-flaky e2e can pin.

### Status filter chips

Use **`<FilterChips>`** (`$lib/components/ui/FilterChips.svelte`) for the
pill-shaped status filter above the table:

```svelte
<FilterChips
    chips={[
        { key: 'all', label: 'All', count: total },
        ...STATUSES.map((s) => ({ key: s, label: m(STATUS_LABEL_KEYS[s]), count: statusCount(s) }))
    ]}
    bind:active={statusFilter}
/>
```

- `chips = [{key, label, count?, alert?}]`. Omit `count` for label-only
  chips; `alert: true` renders the red attention badge (`.count.alert`).
- The "All" chip comes first; the active chip uses `var(--accent-strong)` +
  white — **not** `var(--accent)`, which is only 3.12:1 against white. See
  *Colour tokens and contrast* below.
- **Single-select only.** For a multi-select status filter (e.g. `/invoices`,
  whose filter is an array) keep an inline `<nav class="filters">` chip
  nav — it still uses the global `.filter-chip` / `.count` CSS, so the
  visible text/counts (and the `/^All\s+\d+/` e2e selectors) stay identical.
- **Quick subset, not every status.** When the lifecycle has many statuses
  (`/invoices` has 12), the inline row shows only a small, high-traffic
  *quick subset* — the stages people triage daily (`new`, `ready_for_review`,
  `approved`, `failed`), gated by the active workflow. The **full** set lives
  in the Advanced Search modal. The two share **one** selection array: opening
  the modal seeds its Status section from the live chip selection, and Apply
  writes it back — so they never fight over `params.status` (do *not*
  reintroduce a second status param in `buildParams`). Any status selected only
  in the modal is appended to the rendered chips so an active filter is never
  invisible (`chipStatuses` = quick subset ∪ active). See
  `routes/invoices/+page.svelte` and `tests-e2e/invoices/advanced-status.spec.ts`.

### Modals

Use **`<Modal>`** (`$lib/components/ui/Modal.svelte`) — backdrop +
centred dialog with backdrop-click + Esc to close:

```svelte
<Modal open={showCreate} ariaLabel="<Action>" title="<Heading>" width="sm" onclose={() => (showCreate = false)}>
    <form onsubmit={(e) => { e.preventDefault(); handleSubmit(); }}>
        <!-- labelled fields -->
        <div class="modal-footer">
            <button type="button" class="btn-cancel" onclick={() => (showCreate = false)}>Cancel</button>
            <button type="submit" class="btn-primary" disabled={saving}>{saving ? 'Saving…' : 'Save'}</button>
        </div>
    </form>
</Modal>
```

- `ariaLabel` becomes the dialog's `aria-label` — **e2e specs select
  modals by this exact string**; never change a label on an existing modal.
- Keep the page's own `<form>` **including the `.modal-footer`** inside
  the children so submit still works (Modal does not own the footer).
- `width="sm|md|lg"` = 440/480/820px. Custom heading markup →
  `{#snippet header()}…{/snippet}` instead of `title`. If the body
  dereferences a nullable var, gate `open={x !== null}` and wrap the
  children in `{#if x}…{/if}`.
- Cancel sits left of the primary action. Required-field markers use
  `<em class="required">*</em>`.
- **Never hand-roll a modal shell.** Every dialog — including the feature
  dialogs in `$lib/components/modals/` — wraps its body in `<Modal>`. Do
  not write your own `.backdrop` / `div.modal[role="dialog"]`, your own
  Esc / backdrop-click handlers, or a `<svelte:window onkeydown>` to close
  — `Modal` already owns all of that, and a private copy drifts (the
  `AdvancedSearchModal` overflow + scrollbar bug came from a hand-rolled
  shell that never picked up the global `.modal` CSS). "Bespoke internals"
  means the dialog's *body* (custom field grids, pickers, footers) is
  feature-specific — the shell, backdrop, and close behaviour are not.
  If you find yourself writing `position: fixed; inset: 0` or
  `role="dialog"` in a component, stop and use `<Modal>`.

### Per-row actions

Use the shared `<RowAction>` component (`$lib/components/ui/RowAction.svelte`)
for every per-row button across every grid page. Variants:
- `default` — neutral border, accent on hover (Edit, Apply, link buttons)
- `success` — green border + text (Verify)
- `danger` — neutral by default, red on hover; pass `armed` for the
  filled-red two-click confirm (Delete, Reject, Void)

Renders as `<a>` when given `href`, otherwise `<button>`. Never copy
the `padding: 4px 12px; ...` recipe inline — use the component.

The actions cell is **always the last column** (right side of the row),
preceded by a header `<th class="actions-col"></th>`. The `<td>` uses
`class="actions"` with the standard left-aligned flex layout:

```css
.actions {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    gap: 6px;
    white-space: nowrap;
}
```

Buttons inside align left within the cell — do not use
`justify-content: flex-end`.

For the destructive armed-confirm pattern, outside-click un-arms by
adding a `<svelte:window onclick>` that clears `confirmDeleteId` when
the click target is not within `.row-action`. See
`routes/admin/+page.svelte` for the canonical implementation.

### Clickable rows (`RowLink` + `isRowOpenClick`)

A list row that has a detail/edit destination opens it **by clicking the
row**, not via a separate "Edit"/"View" button. Two layers make this
accessible:

1. **Primary cell** (the id / name / number — `invoice_number`,
   `po_number`, workflow name, user name) wraps its content in
   **`<RowLink>`** (`$lib/components/ui/RowLink.svelte`). RowLink renders
   a real `<button>` (pass `onclick` — opens a modal) or `<a>` (pass
   `href` — navigates), styled to look like plain cell text but
   focusable, keyboard-operable, and announced by screen readers. This
   is the canonical, a11y-correct affordance — a table `<tr>` must keep
   its implicit `row` role (overriding it to `button` breaks column-header
   semantics), so the focusable control lives in the cell, not on the row.
   **Always pass a row-specific `ariaLabel`** (e.g. `Edit invoice INV-42`)
   — e2e specs select on it.

2. **Whole row** carries `class="clickable"` + an `onclick` that opens
   the same destination, gated by **`isRowOpenClick(e)`**
   (`$lib/utils/rowNav.ts`). The guard bails when the click lands on a
   button, link, input, or the `.checkbox-col` / `.actions` cells — so the
   bulk-select checkbox and the kept **Delete** (and other per-row action)
   buttons still work. This is the Gmail/Linear "click anywhere except the
   controls" pattern.

```svelte
<tr class="clickable" class:row-selected={selected.has(row.id)}
    onclick={(e) => { if (isRowOpenClick(e)) editing = row; }}>
    <td class="checkbox-col"><input type="checkbox" … /></td>
    <td class="mono">
        <RowLink onclick={() => (editing = row)} ariaLabel={`Edit ${row.number}`}>
            {row.number}
        </RowLink>
    </td>
    …
    <td class="actions">
        <!-- no Edit/View button — the row opens the editor. Keep Delete: -->
        <RowAction variant="danger" armed={…} onclick={…}>Delete</RowAction>
    </td>
</tr>
```

- **Don't** add a separate Edit/View `RowAction` when the row is
  clickable — the row IS the affordance. Keep destructive / state-changing
  actions (Delete, Void, Verify, Activate…) as `RowAction`s in the
  `.actions` cell.
- **Don't** put `role="button"` / `tabindex` / `onkeydown` on the `<tr>`
  — that's the wrong fix (kills table semantics, conflicts with nested
  controls). The in-cell `RowLink` is the keyboard/AT path; the row
  `onclick` is a pointer-only enhancement.
- Lists with **no per-row detail view** (vendors, exceptions, credit
  memos, payments history/cards) keep their existing conditional
  `RowAction` buttons — there's no single "open" destination to wire.

### Class-name conventions

The class names below are the shared contract (e2e specs select on
them). Their CSS lives globally in `src/app.css`; the markup comes from
the `ui/` primitive in the Source column.

| Pattern | Class | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Page wrapper + header | `.workspace` / `.toolbar` / `<h1>` | `ui/PageHeader.svelte` |
| Data table | `.grid-container` + `table`/`th`/`td`/`.empty` | `ui/DataTable.svelte` |
| Search input | `.search-box` | `ui/SearchBox.svelte` |
| Bulk bar | `.bulk-bar` | `ui/BulkBar.svelte` |
| Bulk delete | `.bulk-delete-btn` (+ `.armed`) | `ui/BulkDeleteButton.svelte` |
| Bulk action | `.bulk-action-btn` | per-route, but always inside a BulkBar |
| Per-row action | `<RowAction>` (variant + armed) | `ui/RowAction.svelte` |
| Clickable-row open control | `<RowLink>` + `.clickable` row + `isRowOpenClick` | `ui/RowLink.svelte` / `utils/rowNav.ts` |
| Filter pill | `.filter-chip` (+ `.active`, `.count`) | `ui/FilterChips.svelte` |
| Tab bar | `.tab-row` / `.tab` (+ `.active`) | `ui/Tabs.svelte` |
| Load more | `.btn-load-more` / `.load-more-row` / `.load-more-end` | per-route, copy /admin |
| Modal dialog | `.modal[role="dialog"]` + `.backdrop` | `ui/Modal.svelte` |
| KPI card | `.kpi` / `.kpi-value` / `.kpi-label` | `ui/KpiCard.svelte` |
| Status badge (invoice) | `<StatusBadge>` | `ui/StatusBadge.svelte` |
| Tinted badge (any tone) | `<Badge tone=…>` | `ui/Badge.svelte` |
| Money / currency | `<Money>` / `formatMoney` | `ui/Money.svelte` / `utils/money.ts` |
| Field-level advisory | `.field-warning` (`role="status"`) | `ui/FieldWarning.svelte` |
| Zero-data onboarding block | `.empty-state` (+ `data-testid`) | `ui/EmptyState.svelte` |
| Checkbox / radio / file | `input[type='checkbox'\|'radio'\|'file']` (global base) | `src/app.css` |

**Native form controls** are dark-themed globally in `src/app.css` so a
bare `<input>` fits the theme without per-route CSS:
- **Checkbox / radio** — `appearance: none` + a drawn mark (white check
  / inset accent dot) so *both* states are themed — empty = subtle
  outline on `--bg`, on = `--accent` fill, plus
  `:indeterminate` (checkbox) / `:focus-visible` / `:disabled`.
- **File input** — `::file-selector-button` restyled to match the
  secondary (`.btn-cancel`) button.
- **Select** — `appearance: none` + a drawn chevron, and the single
  source of truth for the whole select look (border / radius / surface /
  padding / type). Per-component scoped rules override only what differs
  per context (padding, `border-radius`, `font-size`, `width`,
  `--surface` background) and **must not** re-declare the shared
  border/colour/font or use a `background:` shorthand — the shorthand
  resets the chevron's `background-image`. Scoped rules keep ~30px of
  right padding so text clears the chevron. (Because no rule competes on
  `background-image`, the chevron needs **no `!important`** — earlier it
  did, before the scoped rules were collapsed onto this recipe.)
- **Range** — `accent-color: var(--accent)` (the modern cross-browser
  approach; no pseudo-element rebuild).
- `:root { color-scheme: dark }` puts the remaining native controls
  (date pickers, scrollbars) in dark mode; scrollbars are further
  thinned + tinted, the date-picker indicator gets a hover, and
  `::selection` is accent-tinted.

Don't re-add per-route `accent-color` rules on checkboxes/radios — they
only tint the *checked* state and are redundant no-ops under the global
`appearance: none`.

(All Source paths are under `$lib/components/`.) If a shared style is
missing, add it to `src/app.css` (class-scoped) — not a per-route
`<style>`. If you need a brand-new pattern, add a component under
`$lib/components/ui/` and document it here. **Do not** invent a new
class name for an existing pattern, and **do not** re-introduce a
per-route copy of the table/modal/chip/shell CSS.

### Accessibility patterns (WCAG 2.2 AA)

The shared web foundation carries the baseline a11y so route pages
inherit it for free. Reuse these; don't re-solve them per page.

- **Skip link** (`.skip-link`, app.css; WCAG 2.4.1) — the first
  focusable element in both the app shell (`routes/+layout.svelte`)
  and the supplier portal (`routes/portal/+layout.svelte`). Off-screen
  until focused, then a high-contrast pill. Targets `#main-content` —
  the `<main>` element, which carries `id="main-content" tabindex="-1"`
  so the jump lands focus there. A new top-level shell must keep this
  pairing.
- **Landmarks** (WCAG 1.3.1) — the sidebar nav is `<nav aria-label="Primary">`,
  the section sub-tabs `<nav aria-label="<group> sections">`, the portal
  nav `<nav aria-label="Supplier portal">`. Name every nav landmark so
  multiple navs are distinguishable. Page `<h1>` lives in `PageHeader`.
- **Global focus ring** (app.css; WCAG 2.4.7) — a `:focus-visible`
  accent outline covers `a / button / [role=button|tab|option] /
  [tabindex] / input / select / textarea / summary`. Never set
  `outline: none` without replacing it with a visible ring (checkbox /
  radio do this — accent box-shadow). This is the floor; component-local
  `:focus-visible` (RowLink) layers on top.
- **Reduced motion** (app.css end; WCAG 2.3.3) — a global
  `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` block near-zeroes all
  animation/transition durations. Don't gate functionality on a
  transition finishing.
- **Modal / focus trap** (`ui/Modal.svelte` + `$lib/actions/focusTrap.ts`;
  WCAG 2.1.2 / 2.4.3) — `use:focusTrap={{ onEscape }}` on a dialog box
  (with `tabindex="-1"`) moves focus in on open, traps Tab / Shift+Tab
  with wrap-around, closes on Esc, and restores focus to the trigger on
  close. `ui/Modal` uses it, and so do the four pre-existing hand-rolled
  feature shells (`InvoiceModal`, `RunDetailModal`, `BulkRecodeGLModal`,
  portal discount-accept) so every dialog gets identical focus management.
  Prefer `ui/Modal` for new dialogs; if you must hand-roll a shell, add
  `use:focusTrap` rather than re-implementing it.
- **Reorder controls** (WCAG 2.5.7 Dragging Movements) — any drag-to-reorder
  needs a single-pointer + keyboard alternative. The workflow-builder
  `StepNode` pairs its drag handle with per-node Move ↑ / Move ↓ buttons
  (`onmoveup`/`onmovedown` over the canvas `onreorder`). Mirror this for any
  new drag interaction; don't ship drag as the only path.
- **Toast** (`ui/Toast.svelte`; WCAG 4.1.3) — `role="region"` +
  two persistent live containers (`aria-live="assertive"` for errors,
  `"polite"` for the rest). Each toast has a real `<button>` dismiss
  (`aria-label="Dismiss notification"`); auto-dismiss timer kept.
- **Tabs** (`ui/Tabs.svelte`; WAI-ARIA tabs) — roving `tabindex`
  (active=0, others=-1) + Arrow/Home/End key navigation, plus the
  existing `role=tablist/tab` + `aria-selected` + `aria-controls`. The
  caller still gives the panel `role="tabpanel"` + the matching ids.
- **Filter chips** (`ui/FilterChips.svelte`) — `<button aria-pressed>`
  reflects the active chip.
- **DataTable** (`ui/DataTable.svelte`) — auto-rendered `<th>` get
  `scope="col"`. A page that passes its own `{#snippet header()}` owns
  adding `scope` to its `<th>`s.
- **Icon-only controls** — every icon-only `<button>` needs an
  `aria-label` (NotificationBell reflects the unread count; the sidebar
  collapse toggle + profile button carry `aria-label` + `aria-expanded`).
- **De-emphasised rows** (`.row-muted`, app.css; WCAG 1.4.3) — a paused
  subscription, a revoked API key, a deactivated user. Put
  `class:row-muted` on the `<tr>`; the shared rule colours its non-actions
  cells `--text-muted` (5.38:1). **Never spell this as `opacity`.** Opacity
  is GROUP opacity: it composites the row's whole subtree onto the surface
  behind it, so it fades hardest the colours that were already quiet. On
  `--surface` the old fade measured `--text` 5.65:1 @0.6 / 4.34:1 @0.5,
  `--text-muted` 2.77:1 @0.6 / 2.33:1 @0.5, and a tinted `<Badge>`
  2.78–2.93:1 @0.6 — i.e. it was survivable on the one colour that wanted
  dimming and ruinous on every colour that didn't. A colour token also
  needs no carve-out: a descendant that sets its own colour (a `Badge`'s
  `-on-tint` pair, a `RowLink`'s accent) keeps its own calibrated contrast,
  which is why `/admin/api-keys` could drop the `:not(.status-col)` its
  fade had needed. `:not(.actions)` stays — a disabled control is exempt
  under 1.4.3, but an enabled Delete on a paused row is not, and it must
  not read as unavailable either. `opacity` remains correct for an
  **inactive** control (`:disabled` — exempt), a transient `:hover` fade on
  a filled button (measured 4.72–5.10:1), and genuinely text-free
  decoration. Guards: `src/lib/a11y/opacityAudit.test.ts` (static, catches
  the idiom anywhere in the tree) + `tests-e2e/a11y/deemphasised-rows.spec.ts`
  (axe, stubs the list so the faded row is actually on screen — the route
  scan passed for years because a fresh tenant has no paused row).

### Colour tokens and contrast (WCAG 1.4.3)

The palette in `src/app.css` `:root` is small and every colour token has a
**stated job**. They come in families, and picking the wrong member is the one
mistake this codebase kept making:

| Base token — text / icons / borders on a dark surface | `-strong` companion — the FILL behind white text | `-tint` / `-on-tint` pair — the status-badge recipe |
|---|---|---|
| `--accent` `#638cff` | `--accent-strong` `#3f5fd6` | `--accent-tint` + `--accent-on-tint` `#7d9bff` |
| `--success` `#1fa86a` | `--success-strong` `#177a4d` | `--success-tint` + `--success-on-tint` `#26b977` |
| `--danger` `#f87171` | `--danger-strong` `#c43535` | `--danger-tint` + `--danger-on-tint` `#f87171` |
| — | — | `--warning-tint` + `--warning-on-tint` `#dca014` |
| `--text-muted` `#8a8fa0` | — | `--muted-tint` + `--muted-on-tint` `#9aa0b2` |

- **Never put white text on a base token.** All three are mid-tones chosen to
  be legible *as text on the dark surfaces*; white on them is 3.06–3.12:1,
  well under the 4.5:1 bar. That is what the `-strong` half is for, and it is
  the only thing it is for — `--danger-strong` as *text* on `--surface` would
  be unreadable in the other direction.
- **A tinted badge takes the `-on-tint` text, never the base token.** A
  translucent tint lightens the dark surface *toward* text set in the same
  tone, so a base token — chosen to be legible on the BARE surface — lands
  just under the bar once composited. `--accent` on `--accent-tint` is 4.48:1:
  two hundredths short, which is why 29 badges shipped that way unnoticed.
  Write `background: var(--accent-tint); color: var(--accent-on-tint)` and
  nothing else; the pair is calibrated together and carries ≥0.7 of margin on
  both `--bg` and `--surface`. `--danger-on-tint` equals `--danger` on purpose
  — red needs no lift — so that the rule has no exception to remember.
- **`--surface-2` `#232b44` is the hostile surface.** Only `--text` clears
  4.5:1 on it (11.0:1). `--text-muted` is 4.34:1 there — the failure the axe
  guard originally caught. Muted text belongs on `--bg` or `--surface`.
- **Never write a `var(--token, fallback)` fallback.** Every token above is
  declared, so the fallback is dead code that becomes the *wrong colour* the
  day a token is renamed. `--surface-2` shipped for months as
  `var(--surface-2, #232b44)` with the token undefined, two call sites
  disagreeing about the value — that is the bug this rule prevents. Same for
  `--font-mono`, the canonical monospace stack.
- **Text colour comes from a token, not a literal.** A bare `color: #<hex>`
  with no background in the same rule renders on whatever the cascade supplies,
  so it has to be legible on `--bg` and `--surface` — and `#e04040` (the old
  status red) was 4.11:1 on `--surface`, failing in 106 places. `#fff` / `#000`
  are exempt: they're the deliberate on-a-coloured-fill choices. Decorative
  fills (a chart bar, a confidence dot, an SVG `fill`) carry no text and are
  not covered by this.

Two guards enforce it, and neither subsumes the other:

- **`src/lib/a11y/tokenPairing.test.ts`** (vitest, no browser) scans **every**
  stylesheet in `src/` — `app.css` plus every `<style>` block — for a rule that
  sets both `color` and a `background`, resolves both through the palette, and
  fails below 4.5:1 (3:1 when the rule itself declares a large-text size). It
  also fails a bare literal `color:` that can't clear the bar on `--bg` or
  `--surface`, a fallback that contradicts its token, a `var()` on a token
  nothing assigns, and asserts the table above directly. It also measures a
  rule that fades **itself** with `opacity`, because opacity composites text
  and its background down onto the backdrop — so a token that clears the bar at
  full strength can render under it (`--text-muted` at `.85` is 4.24:1 on
  `--surface`). **Don't dim already-muted text with `opacity`**: the token has
  done that job, and the fade only spends contrast. It measures a **translucent
  background** the same way and in the same pass, compositing the tint over each
  backdrop before judging the pair — the check that found all 29 badges. And it
  asserts each `-tint` / `-on-tint` pair directly, so a tone that drifts names
  one token instead of the dozen sites that spelled it. Pure scanners live in
  `a11y/cssAudit.ts`; the WCAG math in `a11y/contrast.ts`.
- **`tests-e2e/a11y/axe.spec.ts`** covers what the scanner deliberately can't:
  a rule setting only `color` inherits its background through the cascade at
  runtime, and an **ancestor's** `opacity` fades a descendant the scan reads as
  fine (a revoked-row fade put `/admin/api-keys`' status pill at 2.44:1). Add a
  route here when you add a page carrying dialogs or dense controls.

What was left was **consistency, not contrast**. 202 rules used to spell a
tinted badge as a hand-rolled `rgba()` plus a literal hex — 44 spellings of what
the five pairs above name. `ui/Badge.svelte` owns the recipe, and **the
conversion tranches are done**: every entry still in the baseline is a
*deliberate keep* carrying its reason in its own stylesheet, not outstanding
work. The tranches moved one file at a time on purpose — the tokens standardise
on alpha `.15`, so converting a `.1` or `.12` rule *visibly strengthens* that
badge's tint, and landing them all at once would make any visual complaint
unattributable. Two real defects surfaced that way (`/goods-receipts` badging
every status green, so a cancelled receipt read as delivered; a draft run tinted
amber in a modal and flat neutral on the page one click apart), which is the
argument for checking what a distinction was carrying before collapsing it.

**`src/lib/a11y/badgeAudit.test.ts` is the ratchet, and the count.** It scans
every stylesheet for a badge-shaped selector (`badge` / `chip` / `pill` / `tag`)
setting both a tinted background and a colour, holds each file to a recorded
baseline, and holds the converted files at zero. A new hand-roll fails on the
file it landed in. Now that no tranche is outstanding, **a new non-zero baseline
entry is a keep that has to argue for itself** — add it with its reason beside
the others, or use the primitive. Don't restate the remaining count in prose —
it goes stale, and the baseline map is the live figure. Reach for `<Badge>` in
new code and whenever you are already editing one of these rules.

**A failure means changing the colour, never relaxing the rule** — there is no
suppression mechanism, because the `-strong` companions mean a correct answer
always exists. Rationale + what was rejected: `docs/decisions.md` §28.

**The one runtime hole:** white-label theming lets a tenant overwrite
`--accent` / `--accent-strong` with any valid hex (`stores/brandTheme.ts`
`brandThemeVars`), which no static scan can see. `accentStrongContrast` /
`accentStrongMeetsAA` (same file, same WCAG primitive) drive a `FieldWarning`
advisory on both surfaces that edit it — `/organization` Branding and the
`/admin/partner` child-branding modal. Advisory, not a block: the backend
accepts any valid hex and the brand is the tenant's call.
