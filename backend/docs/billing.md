# Platform Billing & Metering

How the platform bills its own customers (the orgs/tenants) — plans,
subscriptions, usage metering, entitlement gating, and the pluggable billing
provider. This is the AP platform's *own* revenue plumbing, distinct from the
accounts-payable money path the app manages for customers.

## Where it lives (control plane)

Billing is a property of the **customer account**, so — like `Organization`,
`User` and `ApiKey` — it lives in the **control-plane** DB (`feohledger`) keyed
by `organization_id`. It never fans out to per-tenant DBs. The two tables are in
`CONTROL_TABLES` (`services/tenant_provisioning.py`), guarded by the coverage
test in `tests/test_tenant_provisioning.py`.

**The usage METERS are not.** `extraction_usage` and `card_rebates` are absent
from `CONTROL_TABLES`, so they are created in every **tenant** DB and in none of
the control plane — `to_regclass('extraction_usage')` is NULL in `feohledger`,
whether that database was built by `alembic upgrade head` or by
`scripts/seed.py` (which creates only `CONTROL_TABLES` there). That is why
`GET /api/billing/subscription` hands `rollup_usage` its `tenant_db`, not
`control_db`. Read `Organization.settings`-adjacent placement claims carefully:
"keyed by org" is not the same as "in the control DB".

### Models (`app/models/billing.py`)

| Model | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `Plan` | A sellable tier. `code` (stable machine id, unique) + `name`, `monthly_price` (`Numeric(12,2)`), `currency`, `seat_component` (JSONB), `usage_components` (JSONB), `entitlements` (JSONB, e.g. `{"public_api": true, "max_seats": 25}`), `trial_days`, `is_active`. |
| `Subscription` | Binds one org to one plan. `organization_id` FK, `plan_id` FK, `status` (`trialing`/`active`/`past_due`/`canceled`), `current_period_start`/`_end`, `trial_end`, nullable `external_subscription_id` (the live provider's id). |

**Money invariant:** `monthly_price` is `Numeric`; per-seat / usage component
prices are stored as decimal **strings** in JSONB and parsed back to `Decimal` —
never float, anywhere.

### Default plan catalog + baseline Subscription (`services/billing/plan_catalog.py`)

Every org needs a live `Subscription` for two reasons: `get_entitlements`
fail-closes to `{}` without one (so the public API is unreachable — see
[Entitlement gating](#entitlement-gating-servicesbillingentitlementspy--apidepspy)
below), and `change_plan` 404s with `no_live_subscription` when there's no
starting row to move FROM (so an org could never even upgrade). Before this,
nothing in the app ever created a `Plan` or `Subscription` row outside of
tests — every org was permanently un-entitled with no way out.

`ensure_plan_catalog(session)` idempotently creates the three stable-`code`
plans (`free` / `growth` / `scale`) if missing — never touches a plan that
already exists, so an operator's price/entitlement edits survive a re-run.
`ensure_subscription(session, organization_id=..., plan_code=...)` binds an org
to a plan if it has no live subscription yet (no-ops otherwise — never creates
a second live row, mirroring `uq_subscription_one_live_per_org`); returns
`None` for an unknown `plan_code` instead of raising, mirroring the
skip-silently pattern `tenant_provisioning._provision_into` already uses for
its admin-role lookup.

Wired at every tenant's creation: `tenant_provisioning._provision_into` (CLI
`create_tenant.py` + self-service signup's `/complete`, and the partner
new-child-tenant provisioning path — all three route through
`provision_tenant`) binds every new org to the real **`free`** plan regardless
of the cosmetic `Organization.plan` display string those callers pass (that
field predates this billing model and has long carried values like `"pro"`
that were never a real `Plan.code`). `scripts/seed.py` does the same for the
two demo tenants (and every `e2e<N>` Playwright worker tenant) so local dev
and CI both start with a real, working billing baseline. `free` grants no
entitlements by design — `public_api` is a paid-tier feature; an org reaches
it via `POST /api/billing/change-plan` to `growth` or `scale`.

**One live subscription per org** is enforced by a partial unique index
`uq_subscription_one_live_per_org ON subscriptions (organization_id) WHERE
status <> 'canceled'` (a canceled row is kept for history). Migration
**`0056_platform_billing`** (control-plane-gated + idempotent DDL, mirrors
`0055_api_keys`).

## Usage rollup (`services/billing/usage_rollup.py`)

`rollup_usage(db, organization_id=…, period="YYYY-MM") -> UsageRollup` aggregates
the existing meters into billable counters. **`db` is a TENANT session** — both
source tables live in the tenant DB (see § Where it lives). Pure read, no
mutation, `Decimal`-exact (`card_rebate_totals` sums the `Numeric`
`card_rebates.amount` per currency, so every subtotal is an exact `Decimal`).

| Meter | Source |
|-------|--------|
| `extractions` | count of `extraction_usage` rows in the period |
| `extractions_platform` | the `program_type='platform'` (billable) subset |
| `card_rebate_totals` | `card_rebates.amount` **grouped by currency**, joined through `virtual_cards` (informational this slice) |

`UsageRollup.as_meters()` serializes to a `dict[str, str]` (money + counts as
exact strings) for the API/adapter payload. The rebate meter is emitted **one
key per currency** — `card_rebate_total.USD` — never a bare
`card_rebate_total`.

That is not cosmetic. It was a single cross-currency
`sum(card_rebates.amount)`, which is a quantity in no currency at all, on a
meter a later slice will price — there is no rate that turns
a mixed scalar into a charge, and `card_rebates` carries no currency column of
its own, so a rebate's denomination is only knowable through its card. Hence
the join, and hence the currency living in the meter NAME.

Two consequences worth knowing:

- **An org with no rebates emits no rebate key at all**, rather than a `0.00`
  in an unstated currency. Zero rebates in no currency is not a fact, and one
  shape is better than two: a consumer reads every key prefixed
  `card_rebate_total.` and finds none. The frontend reads it through
  `types/billing.ts::rebateMeterGroups` and renders nothing.
- **The rollup is deliberately org-wide, not entity-scoped.** The platform
  bills the customer ORG, so a subsidiary breakdown is the wrong unit. The
  sibling figure on `GET /api/payments/summary` *is* entity-scoped — same
  table, different question: that one sits beside entity-scoped outflows an
  operator reconciles it against.

## Billing adapters (`services/billing_adapters/`)

Same registry/decorator/dispatcher pattern as the email / PEPPOL / QMS families.

```python
@register_billing_adapter("my_provider")
class MyAdapter(BillingAdapter):
    async def create_subscription(self, request: CreateSubscriptionRequest) -> ProviderSubscription: ...
    async def get_subscription(self, external_subscription_id: str) -> ProviderSubscription: ...
    async def list_invoices(self, *, customer_id, limit=24) -> list[ProviderInvoice]: ...
    async def report_usage(self, report: UsageReport) -> None: ...
    async def create_setup_intent(self, customer_id) -> ProviderSetupIntent | None: ...
    async def list_payment_methods(self, customer_id) -> list[ProviderPaymentMethod]: ...
    def parse_webhook(self, headers: dict, body: bytes) -> BillingWebhookEvent | None: ...
    async def test_connection(self) -> bool: ...
```

`list_invoices(customer_id=…, limit=24)` returns the org's past billing invoices
/ receipts (newest first) as `ProviderInvoice` DTOs (`external_invoice_id`,
`number`, `period`, `amount` — exact decimal **string** — `currency`, `status`
`paid`/`open`/`void`, `hosted_url`, `created_at`). `customer_id is None` (org
never provisioned at the provider) → `[]`. The `BillingAdapter` base supplies a
safe default returning `[]`, so an adapter without a real billing back-end
degrades gracefully rather than 500ing.

`create_setup_intent(customer_id)` starts a **SetupIntent** — collects + saves a
payment method against the customer *without a charge* — and returns a
`ProviderSetupIntent` (`external_setup_intent_id`, `client_secret`, `status`).
The frontend confirms the `client_secret` with the provider's JS SDK to attach
the card; it is single-use and scoped to one intent, and **never carries a PAN**.
`customer_id is None` (never provisioned) → `None`. `list_payment_methods(customer_id)`
returns the org's saved cards as `ProviderPaymentMethod` DTOs —
**PII-safe metadata only** (`external_payment_method_id`, `brand`, `last4`,
`exp_month`, `exp_year`, `is_default`), **never a full PAN**; `None` customer →
`[]`. The base supplies safe defaults (`None` / `[]`) so an adapter without a
real billing back-end degrades gracefully rather than 500ing.

| Adapter | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| `mock` (**default**) | In-process, deterministic, no network/credential. Synthetic `mock_sub_<org>` id; `report_usage` is a no-op; `parse_webhook` reads a dev JSON envelope; `list_invoices` fabricates a stable run of monthly `$49.00` receipts (newest `open`, the rest `paid`) keyed off the customer id, or `[]` when there's no customer; `create_setup_intent` returns a deterministic synthetic SetupIntent (`mock_seti_<cus>` + `<…>_secret`, status `requires_payment_method`) and `list_payment_methods` a single deterministic `visa ****4242` (exp 12/2030, default), both `None`/`[]` with no customer. Local-first. |
| `stripe_billing` | Live key via sops, **fails closed** (`BillingNotConfigured`) without `FEOH_BILLING_STRIPE_API_KEY`. `ensure_customer` / `ensure_price` / `create_subscription` / `get_subscription` / `report_usage` are **implemented** against the Stripe REST API via `httpx` (key as HTTP-Basic username, form-encoded bodies; every create sends an `Idempotency-Key` header so a retry can't duplicate; `report_usage` POSTs one Billing Meter Event per meter with the quantity as an exact decimal **string**, never float). `ensure_customer` resolve-or-creates the per-org Stripe `customer` (idempotency key `ap-customer-<org>`, sends only the org business name + an admin email — never bank/tax/PAN); `ensure_price` resolve-or-creates the per-plan recurring `price` (unit amount = the plan's monthly price in integer **minor units** via exact Decimal math, idempotency key `ap-price-<code>-<cents>-<cur>`). `create_subscription` consumes the resolved `stripe_customer_id` + `stripe_price_id` from config (the provisioning resolver injects them) → `BillingNotConfigured` if absent. A non-2xx raises a PII-free `BillingProviderError` (status + op only, never the response body). `parse_webhook` verifies the `Stripe-Signature` HMAC over the raw body and maps Stripe statuses → our four-state lifecycle. `list_invoices` GETs `/v1/invoices?customer=<id>&limit=` (cap 100), normalizes each to `ProviderInvoice` (amount from the integer-minor-units `total` via exact Decimal → decimal **string**; `created`/`period_start` Unix → ISO/`YYYY-MM`; status map `draft`/`uncollectible`→`open`, `void`→`void`; `hosted_invoice_url` → `invoice_pdf` fallback) — fails closed without a key, returns `[]` for a `None` customer. `create_setup_intent` POSTs `/v1/setup_intents` (`customer`, `payment_method_types[]=card`, `usage=off_session`) → `ProviderSetupIntent`; `list_payment_methods` GETs `/v1/payment_methods?customer=<id>&type=card` and maps each to brand/last4/exp **only** (Stripe never returns a PAN here) — both fail closed without a key, `None`/`[]` for a `None` customer. |

`get_billing_adapter(provider=None)` resolves: explicit arg → `FEOH_BILLING_PROVIDER`
→ `mock`. An unknown name falls back to `mock` (a bad config can't break read
paths). Per-org override: `Organization.settings.billing.provider`. The
dispatcher injects the process-level Stripe key / webhook secret / API base from
config.

## Inbound webhook route (`app/api/billing_webhook.py`)

`POST /api/billing/webhook/{provider}` — **PUBLIC, no JWT** (the provider HMAC is
the gate; the route is in `NO_AUTH_REQUIRED`). The billing provider POSTs here
when a subscription's lifecycle changes (trial ends, payment fails → `past_due`,
dunning exhausts → `canceled`).

Billing is **control-plane** (keyed by org), so — unlike the payment webhook,
which carries the tenant slug in its URL path — this route resolves the affected
`Subscription` by the provider's subscription id **carried in the event itself**
(`external_subscription_id`, persisted on the row at create time). The provider
id is the tenant boundary here.

**Boot guard.** `app/main.py::lifespan` refuses to start (`RuntimeError`, same
pattern as the email-intake / PEPPOL-inbound guards) when
`FEOH_BILLING_WEBHOOK_ENABLED=true` **and** `FEOH_BILLING_PROVIDER` is still `mock`.
The `mock` adapter's `parse_webhook` does zero signature verification by design
(it's a local-only dev double — see "Mock" above) and its
`create_subscription` mints a deterministic `mock_sub_<organization_id>`, so
serving it on the public route in a deployed env would let anyone who knows (or
derives, from their own JWT `org` claim) an org id flip that org's
`Subscription.status` with an unauthenticated POST. The guard only fires when
the webhook route is explicitly turned on — the documented local-first default
(`mock` + `FEOH_BILLING_WEBHOOK_ENABLED=false`) is unaffected, so `pnpm dev` never
requires a real Stripe key. Deployed envs must pair the switch with a real
provider (`FEOH_BILLING_PROVIDER=stripe_billing`, key via sops).

**The guard checks the registry, not just the string `"mock"`.** There are two
ways to end up serving the fixture adapter here and the equality test only saw
one. `get_billing_adapter` falls back to `mock` for **any unregistered name**
(deliberately — a bad config must not 500 the billing read paths), and the
route's own `provider != settings.billing_provider` check compares the URL
segment to the setting, never to the registry. So
`FEOH_BILLING_PROVIDER=stripe` — one plausible keystroke from the registered
`stripe_billing`, and not the literal `"mock"` — booted clean, matched at the
route, resolved to `MockBillingAdapter`, and turned
`POST /api/billing/webhook/stripe` into an unauthenticated subscription-lifecycle
mutator: an unsigned `{"id":…, "type":…, "subscription":…, "status":"canceled"}`
body cancelled a live subscription (and with it every plan entitlement). The
boot guard now refuses any `FEOH_BILLING_PROVIDER` that names no registered
adapter, listing the registered ones — the same allowlist shape
`FEOH_AUDIT_SHIPPING_PROVIDERS` already uses ten lines below it, and §26's
boot-time allowlist applied to the other env-sourced provider name whose
fallback reaches a public route (`../../docs/decisions.md` §26, §29).

As a second line of defence the route itself checks that the name **resolved**
to the adapter it asked for (`adapter.provider_name != provider` → opaque 204),
so the signature-free parser is never reached with a real body even if a process
somehow serves an unregistered name. Guards:
`tests/test_billing_webhook.py::test_boot_refuses_unregistered_provider_with_webhook_enabled`
and `::test_unregistered_provider_is_refused_at_the_route_too`.

Pipeline (mirrors the PEPPOL-inbound webhook, honouring invariant #9):

1. **Master switch** `FEOH_BILLING_WEBHOOK_ENABLED` — OFF in local dev (no outbound
   billing integration), flipped ON in deployed envs. Off → silent 204.
2. **Body-size cap** (512 KiB) checked on the declared `Content-Length` *and* the
   actual read (memory-exhaustion guard on a public route).
3. **Provider match** — the `{provider}` path segment must equal the configured
   `FEOH_BILLING_PROVIDER`, else silent 204 (don't accept a different provider's
   unverifiable payload).
4. **HMAC verify + normalize** inside the adapter's `parse_webhook` (fail-closed:
   no secret / bad signature / unparseable → `None` → silent 204).
   Stripe's `Stripe-Signature` header is `t=<unix>,v1=<hex>` and its verification
   procedure has **two** halves: re-derive the digest over `f"{t}.{body}"`, *and*
   compare `t` against now within a tolerance. Only the digest half was
   implemented, so a captured, correctly-signed event verified forever — the
   `t` was signed over but never read. `FEOH_BILLING_STRIPE_WEBHOOK_MAX_AGE_SECONDS`
   (default 300, the same ±5-minute window the Slack / Teams interactivity
   routes enforce) closes it, in both directions: a far-FUTURE `t` is rejected
   too, or a forged one would buy an arbitrarily long replay window.

   The window is not a duplicate of step 5's dedupe. Dedupe stops the **same**
   delivery being processed twice inside its 72h Redis TTL; the window stops an
   **old** delivery being replayed at all. Past the TTL a captured
   `customer.subscription.deleted` would otherwise cancel a subscription the
   customer has since re-taken. Set the knob `<= 0` to disable the age check —
   the escape hatch for an operator deliberately replaying an archived event
   during an incident.
5. **Dedupe by `event_id`** via `webhook_security.is_event_already_processed`
   (Redis `SET NX EX`, keyed `billing:<provider>:<event_id>`). A provider
   redelivery within the window short-circuits — the lifecycle effect ran exactly
   once.
6. **Apply** the idempotent transition via `services/billing/webhook_processing.apply_billing_event`.

Every rejection path returns **204 silently** with a PII-free reason-code log —
a distinct 4xx would enumerate which providers / secrets / subscription ids are
accepted.

### Status transition (`services/billing/webhook_processing.py`)

`apply_billing_event(control_db, event=…)`:

- drops events with no `external_subscription_id` (account-level, no lifecycle
  effect) or no mapped lifecycle status;
- resolves the `Subscription` by `external_subscription_id` — unknown → drop
  (no enumeration);
- **idempotent**: if the target status already equals the current status it's a
  no-op and writes **no** audit row (mirrors `transition_invoice`'s no-op rule);
- otherwise sets the new status, commits, and writes an **append-only**
  `billing.subscription_<status>` audit row via the shared `dispatch_auth_audit`
  (PII-free: org + from/to status + event id/type; `actor_id=None` — provider-
  driven, no human actor). The audit row lands in the tenant `audit_log` (the
  control plane has none).

The four lifecycle states are `trialing → active → past_due → canceled`; the
Stripe adapter's `_STATUS_MAP` collapses `incomplete`/`unpaid` → `past_due` and
`incomplete_expired` → `canceled`.

## Dunning / past-due automation (`services/billing/dunning_sweep.py`)

The provider's own retry schedule (Stripe Smart Retries) normally drives a
failing subscription `active → past_due → canceled` and each hop arrives via the
webhook above. The dunning sweep is the **backstop** for when a terminal provider
webhook never arrives: a subscription that has sat `past_due` longer than
`FEOH_BILLING_DUNNING_GRACE_DAYS` (measured from `current_period_end`; a row with no
period end is overdue by default) is flagged `canceled` with an append-only
`billing.subscription_canceled` audit row.

**Money-path boundary:** the sweep ONLY changes a `Subscription` status — it
never charges, refunds, or creates any payment-side row. (A canceled subscription
grants nothing via `get_entitlements`; that down-grade is a read consequence, not
a money op.) **Control-plane only** — `Subscription` lives in the control DB, so
one query, no per-tenant fan-out. **Idempotent** — only `past_due` rows are
touched and canceling moves a row out of `past_due`. Long-lived asyncio task in
`main.lifespan`, OFF by default (`FEOH_BILLING_DUNNING_ENABLED`).

## Per-org provisioning (`services/billing/provisioning.py`)

The live `stripe_billing` adapter's `create_subscription` needs the provider-side
`customer` id (one per org) and `price` id (one per plan). `provision_org_billing(control_db, org=…, plan=…)`
resolves those:

1. read `Organization.settings.billing.stripe_customer_id` + `.plan_price_ids[plan.code]`;
2. for anything missing, call the adapter's `ensure_customer` / `ensure_price`
   (idempotent at the provider — a stable idempotency key means a retry returns
   the original object, never a duplicate);
3. persist the new ids back onto `settings.billing` (via `flag_modified`, no
   migration — reuses the existing JSONB block that already holds `provider`)
   and commit, so a later retry reuses them and skips the round-trip;
4. return `ProvisionedIds(customer_id, price_id)`.

`Subscription.external_subscription_id` (an existing column) holds the live
provider subscription id once `create_subscription` returns.

Fail-closed: with the `stripe_billing` adapter and no API key, `ensure_customer` /
`ensure_price` raise `BillingNotConfigured` *before* anything is persisted. The
`mock` adapter returns deterministic synthetic ids (`mock_cus_<org>` /
`mock_price_<code>`) with no network — the local-first default.

The linkage lives in `settings.billing`:

```json
{
  "billing": {
    "provider": "stripe_billing",
    "stripe_customer_id": "cus_...",
    "plan_price_ids": {"growth": "price_..."}
  }
}
```

## Proration (`services/billing/proration.py`)

`compute_proration(old_monthly, new_monthly, period_start, period_end, change_at) -> ProrationResult`
is a **pure, Decimal-exact** function for a mid-period plan change:

```
proration = (new_monthly - old_monthly) * (unused_days / period_days)
```

i.e. credit the unused portion of the old plan and charge the same portion of
the new one. **Positive** = extra charge (upgrade), **negative** = credit
(downgrade), **`Decimal("0.00")`** = same-price or same-plan change.

- `unused_days` = whole (floored) days remaining from `change_at` to `period_end`;
  `period_days` = whole days in the window. `change_at` outside the window
  clamps to the nearest boundary (before start → whole period; after end → zero).
- **Rounding rule:** intermediate products keep full Decimal precision; the final
  amount is quantized to **2 decimal places** with **`ROUND_HALF_UP`** (round half
  away from zero — the convention invoices expect, e.g. `0.005 → 0.01`). Rounded
  exactly once, at the end, so no error accumulates.
- No float anywhere. A degenerate / inverted window or zero remaining days yields
  `0.00` without dividing.

## The billing period (`services/billing/period.py`)

The window `compute_proration` divides by. Plans are flat **monthly**
(`Plan.monthly_price`), so a period is a calendar month anchored on when the
subscription started — `add_months` clamps the day (31 Jan + 1 month is the end
of February, never 3 March).

`current_period(subscription, now=…) -> BillingPeriod` is the single rule its
three readers share:

| Reader | Uses it for |
|--------|-------------|
| `plan_change.change_plan` | the proration window — **and persists** the resolved bounds back onto the row |
| `GET /api/billing/subscription` | what the customer is shown (compute-on-read, no write) |
| `dunning_sweep` | **no** — see below |

Precedence: a persisted window that actually contains `now` wins verbatim (so a
provider-synced window is never recomputed); otherwise the window is resolved
by rolling whole months forward from `current_period_start`, else `created_at`,
else `now`. It is never degenerate, including when `now` precedes the anchor.

**Why this module exists.** Nothing wrote `current_period_start` /
`current_period_end` — `plan_catalog.ensure_subscription`, the only place a
`Subscription` is constructed outside tests, set `id` / `organization_id` /
`plan_id` / `status` and stopped. Both columns were permanently `NULL`, so
`change_plan`'s `subscription.current_period_start or now` fallback handed
`compute_proration` a zero-length window, its degenerate-window guard fired,
and **every** mid-period plan change prorated `0.00` — returned to the
`/billing` UI under an "applies immediately, prorates the current period"
notice, and written as `proration_amount: "0.00"` into the immutable
`billing.plan_changed` audit row. `ensure_subscription` now stamps the first
window at creation, and `change_plan` self-heals a legacy `NULL` (or expired)
one.

**The dunning sweep deliberately reads the raw column, not this.** The two
answer different questions: the summary asks *which period is this
subscription in* (always ending in the future), dunning asks *how long has this
gone unpaid*, whose anchor is the last boundary the subscription actually
billed at. Resolving forward there would put the end date permanently ahead of
`now` and the sweep could never cancel anything.

**The provider is authoritative once it is wired.** `ProviderSubscription`
carries no period bounds yet; when it does, the synced values must win, and
overwriting the locally-resolved window with them is always safe.

## Plan change (`services/billing/plan_change.py` + `POST /api/billing/change-plan`)

`change_plan(control_db, org=…, new_plan_code=…, actor_id=…, change_at=None)`:

1. resolve the target `Plan` by `code` (active only); **404** when unknown;
2. **pre-flight, deliberately UNLOCKED** — confirm the org has a live
   subscription at all (**404**, no enumeration) and short-circuit the
   **idempotent no-op** when it is already on the target plan (`changed=False`,
   zero proration, no mutation, no provider call, **no audit row**; mirrors the
   `transition_invoice` / `apply_billing_event` no-op rule, so a retry of the
   same change can't double-charge). Then `provision_org_billing`
   (resolve-or-create customer + the new plan's price) — fails closed with the
   live adapter and no key, before anything is locked or mutated. This step must
   stay **ahead** of the lock: it commits, and see § Concurrency;
3. resolve the org's live subscription + current plan **row-locked**
   (`_get_active_subscription_for_update`, `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`, `change_plan`-only —
   see § Concurrency below), re-checking both the no-live-subscription and
   already-on-plan cases under the lock (a racer may have moved the org since
   the peek);
4. resolve the subscription's current billing window (`period.current_period`)
   and **persist** it, then compute the proration (`compute_proration`, pure
   Decimal) against it — see § The billing period for why the persisted bounds
   can be absent or stale;
5. drop any stale **canceled** subscription row for the target plan (guards the
   `uq_subscription_org_plan` unique constraint), repoint `plan_id`, and write an
   append-only `billing.plan_changed` audit row (PII-free — org + old/new plan
   code + proration as an exact decimal **string** + day counts), dispatched
   *before* the commit.

**Money-path boundary:** this NEVER moves money directly. The proration is
computed and recorded; issuing the actual charge/credit line is the provider's
job (a live Stripe subscription amendment on the next invoice). The `mock`
provider no-ops, so locally the proration is informational.

Endpoint `POST /api/billing/change-plan` (JWT + `require_roles(admin, cfo)` —
matches the read endpoint) takes `{"plan_code": "..."}` and returns
`{changed, old_plan_code, new_plan_code, proration: {amount, unused_days, period_days}}`
with `amount` an exact decimal string.

### Concurrency

`change_plan` is a classic read-modify-write: read the current plan, prorate
off it, then repoint `plan_id`. Two concurrent *different* plan changes for the
same org (e.g. one request A→B, another A→C) both reading the plain
`get_active_subscription` result would both baseline off `A` — a lost update
where the loser's proration is computed against a stale plan and both land a
`billing.plan_changed` audit row for what should be one coherent change.

The fix locks the subscription row before prorating (`_get_active_subscription_for_update`,
`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`, mirroring `workflow_engine.get_invoice_for_update`) — a
second concurrent call for the same org blocks behind the first's commit, then
re-reads the *already-updated* subscription as its own "current" baseline, so its
proration and `from_plan` reflect the actual prior state at the time it acquired
the lock, not the value both calls originally read. This locked lookup is
`change_plan`-only; the read-only entitlement-check dependencies and
`GET /api/billing/subscription` keep using the unlocked `get_active_subscription`
(no mutation, no need to pay the lock-contention cost). Proven by a real-Postgres
concurrency test (`tests/test_billing_concurrency.py`), the same pattern as
`tests/test_payment_concurrency.py` — a single mocked session can't model two
connections contending for a row lock.

**Two things the lock depends on, both easy to undo by accident.**

*Nothing may commit between taking the lock and the repoint.* `provision_org_billing`
persists the resolved Stripe customer / price ids onto `Organization.settings.billing`
and **commits** — and a commit releases the row lock. It used to be called *inside*
the locked section, so the waiting racer's `FOR UPDATE` unblocked at that commit and
read the still-unrepointed subscription: both changes prorated off the same stale
plan and both wrote a `billing.plan_changed` row claiming the same `from_plan` — the
exact lost update the lock exists to prevent. It fired whenever provisioning had
anything to persist, i.e. on the **first change to any plan the org has no stored
price id for** — the ordinary case, not an edge one. Provisioning therefore runs in
its own transaction *ahead* of the lock (which also keeps the live Stripe round-trip
out of the locked window, so an inbound billing webhook or the dunning sweep can't be
parked behind it on the same row).

*The locked read must carry `populate_existing=True`.* The pre-flight peek loads the
`Subscription` into the session's identity map; without `populate_existing` SQLAlchemy
hands that same instance back from the locked SELECT with its **previously-loaded**
column values, discarding the ones Postgres just returned. The unblocked racer would
re-read a row that had changed and still see the old `plan_id`. `api/webhooks.py::_get_owned_subscription`
sets it before a secret rotation for the same reason.

`tests/test_billing_concurrency.py` covers both arrangements: the original test
pre-provisions `settings.billing` so provisioning is a no-op (isolating the plain
unlocked-read bug), and `test_concurrent_plan_changes_serialize_when_provisioning_persists`
leaves it absent so provisioning genuinely commits.

## Entitlement gating (`services/billing/entitlements.py` + `api/deps.py`)

`get_entitlements(db, org_id)` returns the `entitlements` JSON of the plan behind
the org's **live** subscription, or `{}` when there is none (fail-closed — a
feature is granted only when a plan explicitly includes it).

Two composable FastAPI dependencies in `api/deps.py`, both **on top of** auth —
they never replace `require_roles` / `require_api_scope`:

| Dependency | Surface | On miss |
|------------|---------|---------|
| `require_entitlement("feature")` | JWT (SPA) routes | **402 Payment Required** |
| `require_api_entitlement("feature")` | API-key `/api/v1` routes | **402 Payment Required** |

402 (upgrade your plan) is deliberately distinct from a 403 role denial.

**Wired demonstration:** the public `/api/v1/invoices` read routes now require
`require_api_entitlement("public_api")` alongside `require_api_scope("read")` —
the public API is a paid-plan feature. An org with no plan, or a plan whose
`entitlements.public_api` is falsy, gets a 402; a plan with `public_api: true`
passes.

## Customer endpoint (`app/api/billing.py`)

`GET /api/billing/subscription` (JWT + `require_roles(admin, cfo)`) returns the
tenant's current plan + subscription status + usage-to-date for the current
period:

```json
{
  "provider": "mock",
  "plan": {"code": "growth", "name": "Growth", "monthly_price": "49.00",
           "currency": "USD", "entitlements": {"public_api": true}, "trial_days": 14},
  "subscription": {"status": "active", "current_period_start": "...",
                   "current_period_end": "...", "trial_end": null,
                   "externally_managed": false},
  "period": "2026-06",
  "usage": {"extractions": "12", "extractions_platform": "10",
            "card_rebate_total.USD": "18.40", "card_rebate_total.EUR": "3.10"}
}
```

`plan`/`subscription` are `null` when the org has no live subscription. Money is
an exact decimal **string** (this is a billing surface — exactness is the point).

`GET /api/billing/invoices` (same `require_roles(admin, cfo)` gating) returns the
org's past platform-billing invoices / receipts (newest first), sourced through
the org's billing adapter's `list_invoices`:

```json
{
  "provider": "mock",
  "invoices": [
    {"id": "mock_in_..._2026-06", "number": "MOCK-2026-06", "period": "2026-06",
     "amount": "49.00", "currency": "USD", "status": "open",
     "hosted_url": null, "created_at": "2026-06-01T00:00:00+00:00"}
  ]
}
```

The org's provider-side customer id is read from
`Organization.settings.billing.stripe_customer_id` and passed to the adapter.
**Graceful degradation:** an org never provisioned with the provider (no customer
id), an unconfigured/unavailable provider (the live adapter fails closed without
a key), or any provider error yields an **empty list** — never a 500. Money is an
exact decimal **string**. The frontend invoices/receipts UI ships — see
§ Customer-facing UI below.

### Payment-method endpoint

`POST /api/billing/payment-method/setup-intent` and `GET
/api/billing/payment-methods` (both `require_roles(admin, cfo)`) manage the org's
saved cards, sourced through the adapter's `create_setup_intent` /
`list_payment_methods` capabilities.

`POST .../setup-intent` starts a SetupIntent so the org can add or replace a
card and returns the single-use `client_secret` the frontend confirms with the
provider's JS SDK — no charge, and no PAN ever touches our backend:

```json
{"provider": "mock", "configured": true,
 "client_secret": "mock_seti_mock_cus_test_secret", "setup_intent_id": "mock_seti_mock_cus_test"}
```

`GET .../payment-methods` lists the saved cards as **PII-safe metadata only**
(brand / last4 / expiry — **never a full PAN**):

```json
{"provider": "mock",
 "payment_methods": [{"id": "mock_pm_...", "brand": "visa", "last4": "4242",
                      "exp_month": 12, "exp_year": 2030, "is_default": true}]}
```

Both read the provider-side customer id from
`Organization.settings.billing.stripe_customer_id`. **Graceful degradation:** an
org never provisioned (no customer id), an unconfigured/unavailable provider (the
live adapter fails closed without a key), or any provider error yields
`configured=false` + null `client_secret` (setup-intent) or an **empty list**
(payment-methods) — never a 500.

## Customer-facing UI (`frontend/src/routes/billing/`)

The read/display surface for the endpoint above. Route `/billing`, mounted as
the **Subscription** sub-tab of the existing **Billing** nav group
(`$lib/nav.ts`, `labelKey: 'nav.platformBilling'`), admin/cfo-gated to match the
backend (`require_roles(admin, cfo)`); a clerk/manager is redirected to the
dashboard and never sees the tab.

- `+page.svelte` consumes `GET /api/billing/subscription` via
  `$lib/api/billing.ts::getBillingSubscription` (types in
  `$lib/types/billing.ts`) — the shared `api` client adds the JWT + tenant
  header.
- Renders: the current plan (tier name, monthly price via `<Money>` so the
  exact decimal string is formatted, not re-computed), a `SubscriptionBadge`
  status pill (`trialing`/`active`/`past_due`/`canceled`), the billing-period
  window + trial-end (when trialing), the granted entitlement flags, and the
  usage-to-date meters (`KpiCard`s for extractions / billable extractions /
  card rebates).
- **States:** loading, error-with-retry, and a friendly **empty state** (no
  live subscription → "No active subscription" + a contact-sales link, usage
  meters still shown).
- **Payment methods** (`GET /api/billing/payment-methods` via
  `$lib/api/billing.ts::getBillingPaymentMethods`, types in
  `$lib/types/billing.ts`) is a `DataTable` of the org's saved cards — PII-safe
  metadata only (`Brand ····last4` + `Expires MM/YYYY` + a `Default` pill,
  **never a PAN**) — loaded **independently** of the plan/usage/invoices blocks
  (its own loading / error / **empty** "No payment method on file." states), so
  a slow or failed fetch never blocks the rest of the surface.
- The **Add / replace card** button calls
  `POST /api/billing/payment-method/setup-intent`
  (`startBillingSetupIntent`). The real card-collection form (the provider's
  **Stripe Elements**) is a **deployed-only** piece — it can't run in the
  local-first stack and the static frontend must never call a secret-bearing
  service directly — so the flow surfaces the right next-step state and leaves a
  **clearly-marked seam** for Elements rather than mounting it or hardcoding any
  Stripe key:
  - `configured=false` / null secret (org never provisioned, or the live
    adapter fails closed without a key) → a clear **"Billing is not configured"**
    affordance + a contact link, not an error;
  - a returned `client_secret` → a **"ready"** state with the
    `data-testid="billing-card-elements-placeholder"` seam where Elements mounts
    in production (the `client_secret` is confirmed against the provider's JS SDK
    there; it never leaves that boundary). After the flow the saved-cards list is
    re-fetched.
- **Live plan-change flow.** The "Change plan" button opens a `Modal`
  (`billing-change-plan-modal` — plan list fetched from `GET /api/billing/plans`
  via `$lib/api/billing.ts::getBillingPlans`, cheapest first). Each plan renders
  as a radio option with its `<Money>` price; the org's current plan is marked
  with a "Current plan" pill and its radio is disabled (a genuine change is the
  point — the idempotent same-plan no-op below exists for a race, not as the
  primary UI path). Selecting a different plan enables the confirm button,
  which sits under a plain-language notice that **the change applies
  immediately and prorates the current billing period** — `POST
  /api/billing/change-plan` has no preview-only mode, so the UI never implies
  one. On success the modal switches to a result view: `changed: true` renders
  "You're now on the {plan} plan." plus the REAL returned proration
  (`proration.amount`, exact string, via `<Money accounting>` — positive =
  extra charge, negative = credit) and a plain-language hint explaining the
  sign; `changed: false` (the org was already on the target plan) renders a
  clean "nothing changed" message instead of an error. Closing the result view
  re-fetches `GET /api/billing/subscription` so the plan card reflects the
  change without a manual reload. A "contact us" link stays alongside for
  anything outside the self-serve catalog (enterprise/custom plans).
- `SubscriptionBadge.svelte` (`$lib/components/ui/`) is a new shared status pill
  for the four subscription states (WCAG-1.4.3-calibrated tones, matching
  `StatusBadge`).
- e2e: `frontend/tests-e2e/billing/billing.spec.ts` — header + empty state +
  usage meters, a seeded-Plan/Subscription happy path (plan name, exact `$49.00`
  price, Active badge, entitlement flag), the invoices/receipts list (stubbed
  rows + hosted-url link, empty state), the **payment-methods list** (stubbed
  card → `Visa ····4242` / `Expires 12/2030` / `Default`, empty state) + the
  **add-card flow** (returned `client_secret` → ready/Elements seam;
  `configured=false` → not-configured state), the Subscription section tab
  visible/active for admin, and clerk RBAC (redirect + no tab + API 403 on
  subscription / invoices / payment-methods / setup-intent). The billing rows
  live in the control plane, so the spec seeds them via control-plane psql and
  tears down in `finally`.

## Config

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `FEOH_BILLING_PROVIDER` | `mock` | Billing adapter — `mock` (local-first default) \| `stripe_billing`. Per-org override `Organization.settings.billing.provider`. |
| `FEOH_BILLING_STRIPE_API_KEY` | (empty) | Live Stripe Billing secret key — **no hardcoded fallback**; sops in deployed. The `stripe_billing` adapter fails closed without it. |
| `FEOH_BILLING_STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | (empty) | HMAC secret for Stripe webhook signature verification — no fallback; sops in deployed. |
| `FEOH_BILLING_STRIPE_WEBHOOK_MAX_AGE_SECONDS` | `300` | Replay window on the `Stripe-Signature` `t=` timestamp (Stripe's own default tolerance, and the same ±5 min the Slack / Teams routes enforce). Rejects both too-old and too-far-future timestamps. Complements the `event_id` dedupe rather than duplicating it — see the webhook pipeline above. `<= 0` disables the age check, for an operator replaying an archived event. |
| `FEOH_BILLING_STRIPE_API_BASE` | `https://api.stripe.com` | Stripe REST API base URL — overridable so a sandbox / test can point the adapter elsewhere. The adapter still fails closed without an API key regardless. |
| `FEOH_BILLING_WEBHOOK_ENABLED` | `false` | Master switch for the inbound billing webhook route (`POST /api/billing/webhook/{provider}`). OFF in local dev (no outbound billing integration); flip ON in deployed envs. The route is HMAC-gated regardless; off → silent 204. **Boot guard**: refuses to start when this is `true` and `FEOH_BILLING_PROVIDER` is `mock` **or names no registered adapter** (the mock adapter's `parse_webhook` does no signature verification, and an unregistered name silently falls back to it) — pair with a real, correctly-spelled provider in deployed envs. |
| `FEOH_BILLING_DUNNING_ENABLED` | `false` | Master switch for the dunning / past-due automation sweep. OFF by default; flip ON in deployed envs. The sweep only cancels subscriptions overdue past the grace window — it NEVER moves money. |
| `FEOH_BILLING_DUNNING_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | `3600` | Dunning sweep tick interval. |
| `FEOH_BILLING_DUNNING_GRACE_DAYS` | `14` | Grace window (days from the persisted `current_period_end`) a subscription may sit `past_due` before the dunning sweep cancels it. A row with no period end recorded (one created before `ensure_subscription` stamped one) is overdue by default. |

## Tests

`backend/tests/test_billing.py` — adapter default + fallback, mock determinism,
Stripe fail-closed + webhook HMAC verify/reject, entitlement allow/deny, rollup
Decimal-exactness, the subscription endpoint (plan + status + usage, admin/cfo
gating, null-plan case), the invoices/receipts list (mock `list_invoices`
determinism + amount-as-string, Stripe `list_invoices` shape against a mocked
`httpx` transport + minor-units exactness + fail-closed-without-key + no-customer
short-circuit, and `GET /api/billing/invoices` returning the list with money as
exact strings, no-customer → empty list not 500, admin/cfo RBAC), the
payment-method surface (mock `create_setup_intent` / `list_payment_methods`
determinism + PII-safety, Stripe shape-mapping against a mocked `httpx` transport
+ fail-closed-without-key + no-customer short-circuit, and the
`POST /api/billing/payment-method/setup-intent` + `GET /api/billing/payment-methods`
endpoints returning the client_secret / PII-safe cards, no-customer → not-configured /
empty not 500, admin/cfo RBAC), and the
`/api/v1` plan-gate (402 without `public_api`, 200 with). The control-tables coverage test in
`tests/test_tenant_provisioning.py` includes `plans` + `subscriptions`.

`backend/tests/test_billing_webhook.py` — the live-Stripe adapter calls
(create/get-subscription status mapping + idempotency-key header,
customer/price-required fail-closed, report-usage one-event-per-meter with exact
decimal-string values, empty-meter no-op, PII-free provider error) against a
mocked `httpx` transport (no network); the inbound webhook route end-to-end on
the real-Postgres harness (signed event drives the transition + audit row, bad
signature → 204 no change, dedupe-by-event-id → one effect, idempotent same-
status → no audit, unknown subscription → 204, disabled switch → 204, provider
mismatch → 204); and the dunning sweep (cancels overdue `past_due` + audit +
idempotent re-run, spares within grace). Route auth-gating is in
`tests/test_rbac.py` (the route is in `NO_AUTH_REQUIRED`).

`backend/tests/test_billing_proration.py` — the proration math (upgrade →
positive, downgrade → negative, same-price → `0.00`, `ROUND_HALF_UP` 2-dp
rounding incl. an exact `.005` boundary, no-days-remaining → `0.00`, degenerate
window → `0.00`) + `_to_minor_units` exactness (pure, no DB); provisioning
(mock deterministic ids; live Stripe `ensure_customer`/`ensure_price` with
idempotency keys + minor-units + `create_subscription` succeeding with resolved
ids, all against a mocked `httpx` transport; fail-closed without a key); and the
plan-change service + `POST /api/billing/change-plan` endpoint on the
real-Postgres harness (applies proration + audit row, idempotent same-plan
no-op, retry no-op, no-live-sub / unknown-plan errors, provisioning persistence,
clerk RBAC 403), plus the billing-window regressions: `ensure_subscription`
stamps a one-month window, a subscription with **no** stored window still
prorates (the bug where every change returned `0.00`), and a stale window rolls
forward before the proration is computed. The `change_plan` audit row uses the
`_audit_engine_on_loop` fixture (same loop-binding workaround as the webhook
suite).

`backend/tests/test_billing_period.py` — the pure period rules: `add_months`
day clamping / year crossing / backwards, the window containing `now`, the
half-open boundary, `now` before the anchor, a month-end anchor, and
`current_period`'s precedence (persisted window honoured, stale window rolled
forward, `created_at` fallback, never degenerate).
