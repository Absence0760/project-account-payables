# PO Matching

## Overview

PO matching compares invoices against purchase orders (and optionally goods receipts) to catch discrepancies before payment. This prevents overpayment, duplicate payment, and fraud.

## Match Types

| Type | What's compared | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| **2-way** | Invoice vs. PO (amount, vendor) | Standard — most invoices |
| **3-way** | Invoice vs. PO vs. Goods Receipt (amount + quantities) | Manufacturing, physical goods |
| **4-way** | Invoice vs. PO vs. Goods Receipt vs. Quality Inspection (adds a pass/fail/partial-acceptance gate) | Regulated / high-spec goods where receipt alone isn't enough (pharma, aerospace, food) |

## How It Works

```
Invoice has po_number?
    |
    ├── No → status: "no_po" (skip matching)
    |
    └── Yes → Find PO by number
              |
              ├── PO not found → status: "no_po", issue flagged
              |
              └── PO found → 2-way match
                    |
                    ├── Amount within tolerance → status: "matched"
                    |
                    └── Amount outside tolerance → status: "mismatch", issue flagged
                          |
                          GR exists for PO?
                          |
                          ├── No → stay as 2-way match
                          |
                          └── Yes → 3-way match
                                ├── Quantities match → status: "matched"
                                └── Partial receipt → status: "partial"
                                      |
                                      QualityInspection exists (by GR, else by PO)?
                                      |
                                      ├── No → if require_inspection: inspection_required,
                                      │        status unchanged, quality_hold (warning) raised
                                      |
                                      └── Yes → 4-way match
                                            ├── result == "pass"    → no status change
                                            ├── result == "partial" → status: "partial"
                                            │                          (accepted_quantity shown)
                                            └── result == "fail"     → status: "mismatch",
                                                                       quality_hold (error) raised
```

### Matching is scoped to the invoice's entity

The PO and GR lookups run against the invoice's own subsidiary
(`invoice.entity_id`), derived inside `match_invoice_to_po` rather than threaded
through each call site — the same shape `vendor_matching.match_and_link_vendor`
uses. Scoping is **strict** (no `include_shared`): unlike a vendor or a GL
account, a purchase order and a goods receipt belong to exactly one entity, so a
NULL there is not a "shared" marker. An invoice whose own `entity_id` is NULL
(unstamped / pre-multi-entity) stays unscoped, so single-entity tenants and
legacy rows are unchanged.

Without it, two subsidiaries that each number POs from `PO-1001` and share a
supplier cross-match: the deterministic `created_at DESC LIMIT 1` pick could
return the *other* entity's newer `PO-1001`, and the invoice read `matched` — the
amount control having silently passed against a different subsidiary's order.
`no_po` is the correct answer there, and it is one a clerk can act on.

**`po_number` being non-unique across subsidiaries binds every other reader of
that column too.** `GET /api/purchase-orders/{id}` builds its `linked_invoices`
panel by joining on the number, and did so unscoped — so a US-scoped viewer saw
the UK subsidiary's invoices (number, vendor, amount) on the PO detail. It now
scopes that join to the **PO's own** `entity_id` ∪ unstamped rows (NULL on
`invoices` means *never stamped*, not "shared", and dropping those would hide a
real invoice from the one page that links it to its PO). The scope is the PO's
entity rather than the caller's `X-Entity-ID`, because the panel describes one
PO whichever view the reader has selected. The sync-erp upsert matched the same
way and is likewise scoped to the entity being synced into — unscoped, a sync
run under subsidiary B found A's PO by number and overwrote its `total`, which
silently re-prices the very amount control described above.

The PO **itself** is now resolved through `_get_scoped_po`, too. The by-id route
matched on the primary key alone while the list and counts beside it had been
entity-scoped since multi-entity Phase 2, so the selector was advisory on
exactly the route that hands over a subsidiary's order and its line items —
the shape `api/payments.py::_get_scoped_payment` and
`api/positive_pay.py::_get_scoped_file` already close. An out-of-scope id gets
the **same opaque 404** a missing one does, so it can't enumerate another
subsidiary's POs; the consolidated view (`X-Entity-ID` absent) still reaches
every PO, and `linked_invoices` stays keyed on the PO's own entity precisely so
that view still shows each PO only its own subsidiary's invoices. Covered by
`backend/tests/test_purchase_order_entity_scope.py`.

A PO may have **several** goods receipts (a PO filled by multiple shipments);
the 3-way leg sums `quantity_received` across **every** GR for the PO, so a PO
fully received over two deliveries reads as `matched`, not `partial`. The most
recent GR is the representative row (`gr_id`) for the 4-way inspection lookup.
The PO lookup and the GR lookup both pick a single deterministic row when a
`po_number` / `gr_number` is non-unique — neither column is unique, so they
cannot crash on a duplicate.

### Cancelled receipts do not count as delivered goods

The GR query excludes any receipt whose `status` is in
`po_matching.CANCELLED_GR_STATUSES` (`cancelled` / `canceled` / `void` /
`voided` / `reversed`, compared case-folded). `GoodsReceipt.status` is a
free-form `String(30)` written by the receiving side, so this is an **exclusion
list, not an allowlist**: an unrecognised-but-live status such as
`partially_received` must keep counting, whereas silently counting a cancelled
one is the failure this closes.

The sum used to ignore `status` entirely, so a delivery the business had
explicitly cancelled still filled the receipt leg — the invoice read a full
`3-way` `matched` for goods that were never received, which is precisely what
the 3-way control exists to prevent. The subtler shape is a *partial* delivery
whose shortfall is "covered" by a cancelled GR: the downgrade to `partial`
never fired, so no `po_mismatch` info exception was raised on the part that
never arrived.

A PO whose only receipt is cancelled falls back to a **2-way** match — the
honest answer, since there is no receipt evidence at all. The representative
`gr_id` and the 4-way inspection lookup follow the same filter, so a cancelled
receipt's inspection can't stand in for a live one either.

### Over-receipt

Only `received < ordered` was ever reported. More units booked in than were
ordered passed the leg in silence — and an over-delivery is how an invoice for
quantities nobody authorised acquires its supporting receipt. `received >
ordered` now sets the additive `over_receipt` flag, mirrors it into `details`,
and appends an issue (`Over-receipt: 14 received against 10 ordered (+4)`) that
the invoice modal renders verbatim.

`status` is deliberately **unchanged** by an over-receipt and keeps its four
values. `mismatch` is owned by the amount control, which is the gate that
decides whether the invoice is payable; an over-receipt with an in-tolerance
amount is a receiving discrepancy, not a billing one, and folding it into
`mismatch` would emit a message about an amount variance that isn't there.

`invoice_warnings._refresh_po_match` raises it **independently of `status`**,
the way the 4-way inspection block already does — so it lands on a perfectly
`matched` invoice, which is exactly the case that would otherwise disappear. It
becomes a `po_mismatch` warning at **`warning`** severity (not the `info` a
partial receipt gets: a short delivery is routinely benign — goods in transit —
whereas quantities nobody ordered cannot be explained by timing) plus a
`po_mismatch` exception. When the amount leg has already opened one,
`_ensure_exception` de-dupes per `(invoice, type, open)` and the exception call
is a no-op — the warning still lands, and the amount branch's own message is
left untouched.

Covered by `backend/tests/test_po_matching_cancelled_receipts.py` (matcher +
end-to-end through `refresh_warnings` to the exception row) and
`backend/tests/test_po_matching_wiring.py` (the routing, with the matcher
patched out).

The 4-way leg runs **after** the 3-way GR block. It looks up the most recent
`QualityInspection` in two steps: the matched receipt's own (`gr_id == gr.id`),
then — **whether or not a GR was found** — a PO-level one (`po_id == po.id`
with `gr_id IS NULL`). A `fail` blocks the invoice; a `partial` surfaces the
accepted quantity (pay-only-accepted); a `pass` is a clean gate. When
`require_inspection` is on and no inspection exists for a found PO, the match
flags `inspection_required` so the warnings layer can route a `quality_hold`
exception.

**Both steps matter, and the second one used to be skipped whenever a GR
existed.** `qms_sync` writes a PO-level inspection (`gr_id` NULL) any time the
QMS knows the PO number but not the GR number — `_resolve_gr_id` returns `None`
— and `POST /api/inspections` accepts a PO-only body. Querying the GR-scoped row
*instead of* the PO-level one made those rows invisible the moment any receipt
was booked, and the control then failed **open** in the worst direction: a
`fail` verdict on rejected goods never reached the matcher, the invoice read a
clean `3-way` `matched`, no `quality_hold` was raised, and the supplier could be
paid for goods the business had refused.

The fallback is deliberately restricted to inspections with **no `gr_id` of
their own**. An inspection belonging to a *different* shipment of the same PO
also carries this `po_id`; letting it stand in for the receipt being matched
would substitute one masking bug for another (shipment 2 passed, so shipment 1
reads inspected). Covered by
`backend/tests/test_po_matching_critical_path.py` § 4-way leg.

## Tolerance

The system allows a configurable variance percentage (default: 5%) between invoice amount and PO total.

| Variance | Result |
|---|---|
| Invoice = $1,500, PO = $1,500 | Matched (0% variance) |
| Invoice = $1,525, PO = $1,500 | Matched (1.7% variance, within 5%) |
| Invoice = $1,600, PO = $1,500 | **Mismatch** (6.7% variance, exceeds 5%) |

## MatchResult

```python
MatchResult:
    match_type: "none" | "2-way" | "3-way" | "4-way"
    status: "no_po" | "matched" | "mismatch" | "partial"
    po_id, po_number, po_total
    gr_id  # if 3-way
    amount_variance: float      # invoice - PO in dollars
    amount_variance_pct: float  # as percentage
    within_tolerance: bool
    inspection_id: str | None              # if 4-way
    inspection_result: "pass" | "fail" | "partial" | None
    inspection_accepted_quantity: float | None  # partial acceptance qty
    inspection_required: bool              # require_inspection on + inspection missing
    over_receipt: bool          # 3-way: received quantity EXCEEDS ordered
    issues: list[str]           # human-readable issues
    details: dict               # full match data for audit (has_inspection, inspection_result)
```

`over_receipt` is **additive** on the persisted `invoice.po_match` JSONB shape —
every pre-existing key keeps its meaning, and a row written before it landed
simply lacks the key.

`match_invoice_to_po(db, invoice, tolerance_pct=5.0, require_inspection=False)`
takes both knobs; `invoice_warnings._refresh_po_match` resolves them per-invoice
via `services/matching_rules.resolve_match_rule` (see § Per-vendor / per-commodity
rules) rather than reading the org flag directly.

## Integration Points

### After Extraction
PO matching can run after extraction when the invoice has a `po_number`. The match result can be:
- Stored on the invoice (as a warning or in `state_data`)
- Shown in the invoice modal
- Routed to the exception queue if mismatched

### In the Review Step
Reviewers see the match status:
- **Matched** (green) — PO found, amounts within tolerance
- **Mismatch** (red) — PO found but amounts differ
- **Partial** (yellow) — 3-way match, not all goods received
- **No PO** (gray) — no PO number on invoice, or PO not found

### Before Payment
Mismatched invoices can be blocked from the payment queue until the mismatch is resolved (exception cleared).

### Quality-hold exceptions
The 4-way leg routes inspection outcomes to a dedicated `quality_hold`
exception type (created by `invoice_warnings._refresh_po_match`):

| Inspection outcome | Warning severity | `quality_hold` exception |
|---|---|---|
| `fail` | error | created (error) — invoice blocked |
| missing + `require_inspection` on | warning | created (warning) |
| `partial` | info | created (info) — accepted quantity noted |
| `pass` | — | none |

The existing `po_mismatch` handling is unchanged; `quality_hold` is additive.

### Config
Per-org, in `Organization.settings.matching`:

```json
{
  "matching": {
    "require_inspection": false,
    "tolerance_pct": 5.0,
    "vendor_rules":    { "<vendor_id>":        { "require_inspection": true, "tolerance_pct": 2.0 } },
    "commodity_rules": { "<gl_account_code>":  { "require_inspection": true, "tolerance_pct": 1.0 } }
  }
}
```

When `require_inspection` is `true`, an invoice that matches a PO but has **no**
quality inspection on file raises a `quality_hold` warning/exception (the
inspection is mandatory before payment). Default `false` — 4-way only kicks in
when an inspection actually exists.

#### Per-vendor / per-commodity rules

Both knobs — `require_inspection` and the amount `tolerance_pct` — are
configurable per **vendor** and per **commodity type**, not just org-wide.
"Commodity type" is the invoice's header GL account (`invoice.gl_account`); no
new columns. `services/matching_rules.resolve_match_rule(org_settings, vendor_id,
gl_account)` resolves an `EffectiveMatchRule` and `_refresh_po_match` passes the
result into `match_invoice_to_po`.

Precedence is **per-field** (the two knobs resolve independently): for each
field take the first present value walking

```
vendor_rules[str(vendor_id)]  →  commodity_rules[gl_account]  →
matching.<field>  →  hardcoded default (require_inspection=False, tolerance_pct=5.0)
```

So a vendor rule that only sets `require_inspection` still lets `tolerance_pct`
fall through to the commodity / org / default layers. The resolver is pure (no
DB / I/O) and never raises — malformed config (non-dict rules, missing keys,
`None` vendor/GL, non-numeric tolerance) silently falls to the next layer. The
returned `source` ("vendor" | "commodity" | "org" | "default") records where
`require_inspection` resolved from, for logging.

**`tolerance_pct` accepts an exact decimal string as well as a number.** These
rules live in a hand-edited JSONB blob where a decimal string is this project's
own money representation (`auto_approve_below` is stored that way in
`steps_config`), and `match_invoice_to_po` already types the parameter
`Decimal | float | int | str`. This matters because falling through does **not**
fail closed here: the walk ends at `DEFAULT_TOLERANCE_PCT` (5.0), looser than
any tolerance an org would bother configuring. A supplier tightened to
`"tolerance_pct": "1.0"` silently got 5%, so an invoice 4.5% over its PO read
`within_tolerance: true` → `matched` → no `po_mismatch` exception → into the
approval queue as clean, with no log line to notice. Bools are still rejected
(`true` would resolve to a 1% tolerance nobody asked for) and so are non-finite
values; both fall through rather than becoming a rule.

### Where an inspection is entered (the UI)

`/goods-receipts` is the entry surface, because an inspection is tied to a
goods receipt. The page has two tabs:

- **Receipts** — the deliveries (unchanged). A receipt's detail modal grew a
  **Quality Inspections** panel listing that receipt's rows newest-first (the
  order the matcher itself picks from) plus a **Record inspection** button that
  opens the form with the receipt already fixed.
- **Inspections** — the `QualityInspection` rows the tenant holds, newest
  first, behind a Load-more control, with a **Sync from QMS** action and a
  **+ Record Inspection** action. This flat list is not a convenience: a synced
  row often resolves to neither a receipt nor a PO (`_resolve_gr_id` /
  `_resolve_po_id` return `None` when the QMS names a document this tenant does
  not hold), and such a row exists nowhere else in the app. It renders as
  **Not linked**, titled with what that means — PO matching will never read it.

Three things the form encodes, each of them a property of the matcher rather
than a UI preference:

- **`partial` requires an accepted quantity.** The matcher renders the figure
  into its `Partial acceptance: N of ordered quantity accepted` issue, and
  falls back to the word `part` when there is none — true, and useless to
  whoever works the resulting `quality_hold`. The three outcomes are a radio
  group, each labelled with what it does to the match (`pass` leaves it alone,
  `fail` drops it to `mismatch` and blocks payment, `partial` drops it to
  `partial`).
- **A receipt is mandatory in the form**, even though `POST /api/inspections`
  accepts a body with neither `gr_id` nor `po_id`. The matcher only ever reads
  an inspection through the matched receipt's `gr_id`, or through a PO-level
  row whose `gr_id` IS NULL — so an unlinked row is invisible to the match it
  was recorded for. Offering that as a form option would let someone record a
  failed inspection, see it listed, and watch the invoice pay anyway. The
  receipt carries the PO, so both ids go up together.
- **The panel does not claim an inspection is always required.** Whether one is
  mandatory before payment is resolved per invoice by `services/matching_rules`
  (vendor rule → commodity/GL rule → org default), so the standing hint says
  exactly that.

#### The list is a page, and it names its own receipts

`GET /api/inspections` returns a PAGE on the canonical `page` / `page_size`
contract (`app/api/pagination.py`) with the usual `{items, total, page,
page_size}` envelope, ordered `created_at DESC, id DESC` (`created_at` alone is
not a total order — a QMS sync writes a batch in one transaction, and a tie
split across a page boundary drops one row and repeats another). It used to
return every row: the table only ever grows, so the response size was a function
of how long the tenant had been running.

Two things landed with the page, because the tab could not have been paged
correctly without them:

- **`gr_number` rides the row**, resolved by an outer join on the list, the
  detail and the create response alike. The row used to carry `gr_id` alone, so
  the page fetched a 100-row page of goods receipts *alongside every inspection
  load* purely to build an id→number map — and any receipt outside that window
  still rendered unlabelled, a defect a bigger page size could only move. It is
  `null` only when the inspection is linked to no receipt, which the tab renders
  as **Not linked** — a different fact from "linked to a receipt we could not
  name". A receipts fetch still backs the record form's receipt PICKER, but it
  is loaded once per tab activation and skipped entirely for a user who cannot
  record one.
- **`?gr_id=` narrows to one receipt**, which is what the receipt detail modal's
  Quality Inspections panel asks for. It used to filter the tab's list in the
  browser; against a PAGE that would render an empty "no inspections" panel for
  any receipt whose rows had not been paged to yet.

There is no rollup beside this list — inspections are counted, not summed — so
the only figure to keep honest is `total`, and it comes from
`_inspection_list_filters`, the same builder the rows go through.

Quantities are held and sent as the **raw text** the inspector typed, validated
by shape (`\d{1,8}(\.\d{1,4})?`, matching the `Numeric(12, 4)` column) rather
than parsed through `Number` — the same discipline the money inputs use, and
the reason the fields are `type="text" inputmode="decimal"` (Svelte's
`bind:value` on a `type="number"` input hands back a JS number).

**RBAC mirrors the router**: reading the list is open to any authenticated user
(`get_current_user`), while recording and syncing are admin / ap_manager, gated
in the page on `auth.isManager`. A clerk sees every inspection and no button;
`require_roles` refuses the write regardless.

**The Sync action reports what the sync did**, not merely that it ran: the
counts on success, `already up to date` when a re-pull matched what is stored
(the upsert is idempotent on `(org, inspection_number)`), an explicit "the
provider returned no inspections" when `fetched` is 0, and — for both 409s — the
backend's own explanation verbatim, because *that* is the outcome an operator
asked for. Frontend module: `frontend/src/lib/api/inspections.ts`; UI:
`frontend/src/routes/goods-receipts/` (`+page.svelte` +
`RecordInspectionModal.svelte`).

### QMS integration (inspection sync)

Quality-inspection rows can be pulled from an external QMS / LIMS rather than
only entered by hand. Same pluggable-adapter shape as the other provider
families (`financing_adapters`, `fx_adapters`, …):

- **Adapters** (`services/qms_adapters/`): `mock` (deterministic pass/fail/partial
  fixtures, no network/credential — the local-first default) and `generic` (an
  httpx skeleton that **fails closed** without a per-org `base_url` + `api_key`;
  no hardcoded secret). Registry via `@register_qms_adapter`; selected per-org via
  `Organization.settings.qms.provider`, falling back to `FEOH_QMS_PROVIDER`
  (default `mock`). Contract: `async fetch_inspections(*, since=None) ->
  list[QMSInspectionRecord]` + `async test_connection() -> bool`.
  `generic.fetch_inspections` raises **however it is configured** — the live REST
  body is unwritten — so its `test_connection` returns `False` on credentials
  alone too: an operator learns at configuration time that the integration
  cannot pull anything, rather than on the first sweep. That pairing is
  declared and enforced registry-wide by
  `tests/test_adapter_contract_integrity.py` (with the consequence recorded:
  the sweep registers a failed run and shows `degraded` on
  `GET /api/health/sweeps`). Raising is deliberate here — fabricating
  inspection rows would forge the 4-way-match quality leg.
- **Sync** (`services/qms_sync.py`): `sync_tenant_inspections` fetches records,
  resolves each record's `po_number` / `gr_number` to local `PurchaseOrder` /
  `GoodsReceipt` ids, then **upserts** a `QualityInspection` idempotently keyed on
  `(organization_id, inspection_number)` (re-run updates in place, never
  duplicates). Each record that genuinely **lands or changes** writes an
  append-only `quality_inspection.synced` audit row (PII-free: inspection number
  + resolution outcome only). A re-fetched record identical to the stored row
  counts `unchanged` and writes nothing — the audit write used to be
  unconditional, with `change` reading `"updated"` even when nothing had moved,
  so every tick appended `len(records)` rows to `audit_log`. That table is
  append-only at the DB level (migration 0022's BEFORE-DELETE trigger) and is
  drained to a WORM store, so the rows could never be reclaimed, and each one
  described a state change that did not happen. After the
  upsert it best-effort re-runs `invoice_warnings.refresh_warnings` (inside a
  SAVEPOINT) for invoices referencing the affected POs so a fresh quality verdict
  re-gates the 4-way match — never fails the sync.
- **The pull is incremental.** The adapter contract has always been
  `fetch_inspections(*, since=None)`, but `since` was accepted by
  `run_qms_sync_once` and then dropped — every hourly tick re-fetched each
  tenant's entire inspection history. It now threads `run_qms_sync_once` →
  `_sweep_tenant` → `sync_tenant_inspections` → `fetch_inspections`. The per-org
  high-water mark lives in the settings JSON at
  `Organization.settings.qms.last_synced_at` (no migration; the same shape as
  `cash_flow_alerts`' alerted-period marker), is captured **before** the fetch
  and stored only on success — so the window is closed-on-the-left and never
  skips a record written while a tick was in flight, and a tenant whose sweep
  raised keeps its old mark and retries the same window. A boundary record
  simply arrives twice and the idempotent upsert absorbs it.
  `run_qms_sync_once(since=...)` overrides every org's mark for one call — an
  operator backfill, not the normal path. **The manual
  `POST /api/inspections/sync` route deliberately passes no cursor and advances
  none**: a human asking to sync now is usually asking *because* they suspect
  the incremental window missed something, and answering that with an empty
  result would be useless.
- **An unmappable disposition is SKIPPED, never coerced.**
  `qms_sync.normalize_disposition` maps the provider's verdict onto
  `pass`/`fail`/`partial`, normalising case and whitespace only (`"FAIL"` is a
  reading, not a guess). Anything genuinely outside the vocabulary —
  `"rejected"`, `"quarantine"`, `""` — yields no row and increments `skipped`,
  with a PII-free warning naming the inspection number and the provider. It used
  to fall back to **`pass`**, which is the one value the match treats as
  no-status-change, so a QMS emitting its own vocabulary for a rejected lot
  cleared the quality gate and the invoice became payable. Leaving no row is the
  fail-closed outcome: an org with `require_inspection` gets "Quality inspection
  required but missing", one without is unaffected. Mapping the vocabulary
  remains the adapter's documented contract; this is the backstop.
- **Opting in is one rule, shared** — `qms_sync.resolve_opted_in_qms_config`:
  an org-level `settings.qms` block, or a platform provider override
  (`FEOH_QMS_PROVIDER != "mock"`, which opts every org in with the default
  config). Both the sweep and the manual route read it, so they cannot drift.
- **Sweep** (`run_qms_sync_loop`): a long-lived asyncio task (mirrors
  `contract_renewal`) that sweeps every tenant DB on `FEOH_QMS_SYNC_INTERVAL_SECONDS`.
  Disabled by default (`FEOH_QMS_SYNC_ENABLED=false`); orgs that have not opted
  in are skipped.
- **Manual trigger**: `POST /api/inspections/sync` (admin / ap_manager) runs one
  sync for the current tenant, returning `{fetched, created, updated, unchanged, skipped}`.
  It applies the **same** opt-in rule and **409s** when the org has no QMS
  configured. Without that guard `get_qms_adapter(None)` resolved to the `mock`
  adapter, and one call persisted its three fabricated fixtures
  (`QMS-INSP-001 pass / PO-1001` …) against the tenant's REAL purchase orders —
  a synthetic `pass` clearing the quality gate on a real invoice, a synthetic
  `fail` flipping others to `mismatch`, and rows indistinguishable from genuine
  ones in the UI. The sweep already guarded this; the route did not.
- **A NAMED provider we have no adapter for is refused, never `mock`.** The
  opt-in rule above covers an org that configured *nothing*; this is the other
  half — an org that configured *something we cannot honour*.
  `get_qms_adapter` resolves an absent/empty provider to `mock` (the local-first
  default) but raises `UnknownQmsProviderError` for an unregistered name. It used
  to fall back to `mock` there too, and the consequence is the one this whole
  section is about: three fabricated fixtures resolved against real purchase
  orders and persisted as `completed` inspections — the quality leg of the 4-way
  match forged, so a PO is cleared for payment by an inspection that never
  happened. It is sharper for the platform override than for a single org: a
  typo'd `FEOH_QMS_PROVIDER` opts **every** org in at once, so the next tick
  pulled fixtures into every tenant in the estate. `decisions.md` §29 / §36
  applied to this family.

  The two callers differ, and the difference is the cursor:

  | Caller | On refusal |
  |---|---|
  | The background sweep | A **counted per-tenant failure**, not a skip — a skip is indistinguishable from "this tenant had nothing to sync", which is precisely the state the control has silently been in; a counted failure reaches the consecutive-failure streak and shows `degraded` on `GET /api/health/sweeps`. The log line names the bad value rather than an exception class, so it is actionable. Critically, `last_synced_at` is **not** advanced: `_store_cursor` sits on the success path only, because closing a window that was never pulled would skip every inspection written during the outage *forever* once the config is corrected. |
  | `POST /api/inspections/sync` | **409** naming the bad value and the registered alternatives — matching the sibling "no QMS configured" refusal. An operator asked for this pull directly; a clean all-zero summary would hide why it found nothing. The adapter resolves before any query, so nothing is persisted. |

  Guard: `tests/test_adapter_registry_fail_closed.py`.

## Data Models

The procurement models already exist:

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `purchase_orders` | PO header (po_number, vendor_id, total, status) |
| `po_line_items` | PO lines (description, quantity, unit_price, total) |
| `goods_receipts` | GR header (gr_number, po_id, received_date, status) |
| `gr_line_items` | GR lines (description, quantity_received) |
| `quality_inspections` | Inspection header (inspection_number, po_id, gr_id, result, accepted/rejected_quantity, deviation_notes) — the 4-way leg |

## API

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/invoices/{id}/match` | Run PO matching for an invoice (planned) |
| `GET` | `/api/invoices/{id}/match-result` | Get the match result (planned) |

> The matcher has no dedicated HTTP entry point — it runs inside
> `invoice_warnings.refresh_warnings`, which fires on every invoice mutation
> (`PATCH /api/invoices/{id}`), persisting the result on `Invoice.po_match`.
> `POST /api/invoices` does **not** run it, and the `_refresh_po_match` guard
> skips draft `new` invoices, so the computed `po_match` first appears after the
> invoice leaves `new` and is next PATCHed.

## End-to-end coverage

`frontend/tests-e2e/matching/` exercises the matcher through the real
PATCH→`refresh_warnings`→`match_invoice_to_po` path (PO/GR rows seeded via
`tenantPsql`, inspections via `POST /api/inspections`, invoice via the API):

- `two-three-way.spec.ts` — 2-way tolerance band (within / boundary `<=5%` /
  outside → `mismatch` + `po_mismatch` exception by severity), `no_po`,
  fractional-cent variance precision, 3-way full/partial/amount-mismatch
  outcomes, `po_match` clears when `po_number` is removed, recompute idempotence.
- `four-way-inspection.spec.ts` — Quality-Inspection gate (`pass`/`fail`/`partial`
  → status + `quality_hold` severity), late inspection re-gating on recompute,
  org-wide `require_inspection` (missing → `quality_hold` warning), commodity-GL
  tolerance override.
- `rules-and-isolation.spec.ts` — `matching_rules` per-field precedence
  (vendor > commodity > org > default; malformed rule fails soft) asserted via
  `po_match.details.tolerance_pct`, and tenant isolation (a PO is invisible to a
  different tenant).
- `inspections-api.spec.ts` — `/api/inspections` create/list/detail round-trip,
  the paginated envelope + its `page_size` cap, `?gr_id=` narrowing, `gr_number`
  on every path,
  result-enum + bad-uuid 400s, 404, and the create RBAC gate (clerk denied).
- `inspection-ui.spec.ts` — the same three gate outcomes driven through the
  **app** instead of the API: a `pass` recorded from a receipt's detail modal, a
  `fail` recorded from the Inspections tab (with the notes typed into the form
  quoted back in the match issue), a `partial` carrying its accepted quantity,
  the clerk role gate on both mutate controls, and the Sync-from-QMS action —
  its 409 refusal when no QMS is configured, its counts, and its
  "already up to date" report on an idempotent re-run.

`goods-receipts/three-way-feed.spec.ts` proves a GR actually changes the match
outcome (presence → 3-way; short receipt → `partial`).
