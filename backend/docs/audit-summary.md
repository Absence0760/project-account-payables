# Audit Log Summarization

A one-paragraph, plain-English summary of an invoice's audit timeline,
shown at the top of the invoice detail modal so a reviewer can catch up
without parsing a 15-row timeline. Built from the audit log plus the
latest extraction's confidence + priors metadata.

- Service: `app/services/audit_summary.py`
- Endpoints: `GET /api/invoices/{id}/summary`, `POST /api/invoices/{id}/summary/regenerate`
- Cache: `invoices.meta["audit_summary"]` (JSONB)
- Config: `AP_AUDIT_SUMMARY_ENABLED` (default `true`), `AP_AUDIT_SUMMARY_MODEL` (defaults to `AP_EXTRACTION_MODEL`)

## Cache-freshness mechanism

Audit rows are written from ~10 call sites via `dispatch_audit` — there is
no single chokepoint, and in `lambda` audit mode the write happens
out-of-process. Rather than try to bump a counter on every write, freshness
is **derived from the audit log itself**.

The cache stores a `source_fingerprint`:

```
source_fingerprint = { "count": <count of audit rows for this correlation_id>,
                       "last_at": <max(created_at) ISO string> }
```

On modal open, `GET /summary` cheaply recomputes that fingerprint
(`SELECT count(*), max(created_at) FROM audit_log WHERE correlation_id = :cid`,
using the existing index on `correlation_id`) and compares it to the cached
value:

- **match** → return the cached text (no LLM call)
- **mismatch** (or `force=True` via `/regenerate`) → rebuild the summary,
  write the new text + fingerprint back to `meta`, return it

This needs **zero changes to any audit write path** and works identically in
`local` and `lambda` audit modes — every status transition, correction,
exception resolution, and ERP-sync event already writes an audit row, so the
fingerprint moves and the summary regenerates naturally.

## Cached shape

`invoices.meta["audit_summary"]`:

```json
{
  "text": "Invoice INV-42 from Acme Hosting for 4200.00 USD was AI-extracted, then submitted for review, then approved by Manny Manager, then sent to ERP. It was auto-extracted at 95% confidence with RAG priors applied.",
  "confidence_context": "auto-extracted at 95% confidence with RAG priors applied",
  "source_fingerprint": { "count": 6, "last_at": "2026-05-01T10:09:00+00:00" },
  "generated_at": "2026-06-11T12:00:00+00:00",
  "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514"
}
```

## LLM plumbing + local-first

Modeled on `services/llm_fraud_detection.py`: a pure `build_prompt` /
`parse_response` pair and an async `summarize(...)` with an injectable
`http_post` for tests. Config is resolved the same way extraction is — platform
(`anthropic_api_key` + `extraction_model`) or BYOK (`org_settings.extraction`).

**Fail-soft / mock path.** Any unavailable-LLM condition (no API key, mock /
disabled, empty events, network error, non-200, unparseable response) falls
back to a deterministic *template* summary built from the same events without
an LLM call. With the committed `.env.development` default (empty
`anthropic_api_key`), a fresh clone shows a real template summary with no
network dependency — this is the "mock adapter" equivalent. No new infra
profile is needed; the existing `pnpm dev` path exercises it. A real local LLM
(`pnpm ollama:up`) honors the same provider config if desired.

## PII / banking discipline

The prompt and cached text exclude banking / PII — no `vendor_tax_id`, no
remit-to bank details, no card PANs, no full addresses. Audit-row `details`
are scrubbed to a conservative whitelist (`_SAFE_DETAIL_KEYS`) before they
reach the prompt. Only invoice number, vendor name, amount (stringified — never
a float for storage), currency, status events, and extraction confidence ride
along. The service logs only counts / ids.

## Auth & invariants

- Both routes carry an auth dependency (`require_roles`) — `GET /summary` is
  open to any AP role; `POST /summary/regenerate` is admin/manager only.
  Covered by `tests/test_rbac.py`.
- Tenant isolation via `get_tenant` / `get_tenant_db`; a cross-tenant request
  404s.
- Read-shaped: the endpoint may lazily write the cache, but the write is
  fingerprint-idempotent and moves no money, so no idempotency key is needed.
- The audit log is only *read*; no append-only audit row is consumed or
  mutated.

## Tests

- `backend/tests/test_audit_summary.py` — prompt contract (all event types +
  confidence + PII exclusion), `parse_response` tolerance, deterministic
  template, `summarize` fail-soft + happy path.
- `backend/tests/test_invoices_summary_api.py` — endpoint shape, 404, tenant
  isolation, fingerprint freshness (cached until a new audit row moves the
  fingerprint), `meta` persistence, regenerate + RBAC.
- `frontend/tests-e2e/invoices/summary.spec.ts` — summary paragraph renders at
  the top of the modal; admin regenerate.
