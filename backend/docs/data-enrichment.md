# Intelligent Data Enrichment from Supplier History

Advisory enrichment derived **deterministically** from each tenant's *own*
historical invoice data. No external calls, no cloud key — runs on a laptop
with `pnpm dev` and the mock adapters (local-first invariant). Four surfaces,
three read-only endpoints, all suggestion-only / compute-on-read.

A fifth surface — **external enrichment** (firmographics from D&B / Clearbit) —
is bolted on via a pluggable adapter family with a deterministic `mock` default,
so it too runs with no cloud account; the real providers fail closed without a
key. See [§ External enrichment (D&B / Clearbit)](#external-enrichment-db--clearbit) below.

| Surface | What it does | Persists? |
|---|---|---|
| **Auto-fill** | Suggests the dominant historical `gl_account` / `cost_center` / `payment_terms` for a draft invoice's vendor | No — advisory |
| **Price variance** | Flags draft line items whose unit price deviates from the vendor's per-item historical median | Yes — also persisted as a warning + `price_variance` exception on every invoice mutation (returned inline too) |
| **Vendor scoring** | Accuracy + dispute + on-time sub-scores → renormalized composite | No — compute-on-read |
| **Vendor consolidation** | Clusters likely-duplicate / similar vendors so the master list can be deduped (suggest), then folds a steward-confirmed cluster into one canonical vendor (execute) | Suggest — advisory. Execute (`/consolidation/merge`) — yes: reassigns every `vendor_id` FK to the canonical, retires the duplicates, audited |

Pure statistics live in `app/services/vendor_enrichment.py` (sync, DB-free,
unit-testable); the SQL + response shaping live in `app/api/enrichment.py`. All
money / price math is `Decimal`; every numeric serialises as a **string** on the
wire (never a float). No vendor PII (`tax_id`, `bank_details`, address) ever
enters a response or a log line.

## Sibling to `vendor_priors`, not an extension

`services/vendor_priors.py` is a **correction cache**: one row per
`(vendor, field)`, holding the most-recently corrected value, silently overlaid
onto low-confidence extractions during extraction. This module is a different
shape — **distribution statistics over many historical invoices**, surfaced as
advisory hints to a reviewer and **never written back onto the invoice**. The
two read overlapping vendor history but share no write path (`vendor_enrichment`
is pure read), so there is no coupling or write-contention. The cost is a second
pass over the vendor's invoices, acceptable for an on-demand reviewer endpoint
(bounded `LIMIT`).

## Auto-fill

`suggest_fields(history_rows, current)` → `list[FieldSuggestion]`.

- History = the vendor's **approved-or-beyond** invoices (a draft/rejected
  invoice's coding is unreviewed noise), newest first, `LIMIT 50`, excluding the
  draft itself.
- Per field (`gl_account`, `cost_center`, `payment_terms`): take the dominant
  non-null value, `confidence = (occurrences / sample_size) * 100`.
- **Suppression rules** (suggestion-only / non-destructive):
  - Skip if the draft already holds a non-empty value for that field — never
    propose overwriting what the reviewer / extraction already set.
  - Skip if `confidence < MIN_CONFIDENCE` (default `60.0` — the value must be the
    majority).
  - Skip if `sample_size < MIN_SAMPLE` (default `3`).
- Ties break by **most-recent occurrence** (history is newest-first), so output
  is deterministic across runs.
- We do **not** name-match a vendor-less draft — too loose; it could suggest
  another vendor's GL. A vendor-less draft returns empty arrays.

## Price variance

`detect_price_variance(draft_lines, history_lines)` → `list[PriceVarianceFlag]`.

- Item key: prefer `item_code` (`code:<lower>`), else a normalized description
  (`desc:<lower, whitespace-collapsed, edge-punctuation-stripped>`). An empty /
  None description with no code is **unkeyable** and skipped (no baseline).
- Baseline is keyed by **`(item_key, currency)`** — a draft line is only ever
  compared against same-currency history. A vendor that bills in both USD and
  EUR never has its USD line judged against an EUR-pooled median (that produced
  a bogus `delta_pct` + a false over/under flag). `currency` defaults to `USD`
  (the `Invoice.currency` default) when absent. A line with **no same-currency
  history** is skipped (N/A), exactly like one with too little history.
- Baseline = the **median** of the item's same-currency historical unit prices
  (robust to a single outlier), quantized to cents.
- Flag when `abs(delta_pct) >= PRICE_TOLERANCE_PCT` (default `15.0`), needing
  `>= PRICE_MIN_HISTORY` (default `2`) prior prices for that item.
- `severity = "warning"` when `abs(delta_pct) >= PRICE_ESCALATE_PCT` (default
  `30.0`), else `"info"`. `direction = "over" | "under"`.
- History line rows are capped at `PRICE_HISTORY_LIMIT` (default `500`).

**Persisted as a warning + exception (the follow-up, now shipped).**
`invoice_warnings.refresh_warnings` — the single write chokepoint that runs on
every invoice mutation and after every extraction — calls
`_refresh_price_variance`, which reuses the **same pure `detect_price_variance`**
math (no re-implementation). For an extracted invoice (status `!= new`) with a
`vendor_id`, it:

- pulls this vendor's approved-or-beyond historical line items (same set + same
  `(item, currency)` keying as the advisory endpoint, bounded by
  `PRICE_HISTORY_LIMIT`) and the draft's own line items;
- appends one `price_variance` warning per flagged line to `Invoice.warnings`
  (severity `warning`/`info`, same thresholds as the inline surface); and
- raises **one** de-duped `price_variance` `Exception` covering all flagged
  lines (severity escalates to `warning` if any line cleared the escalate
  threshold). Dedup is via `_ensure_exception` — re-running on the same invoice
  never piles up duplicate open exceptions, exactly like `fraud_stat_anomaly`.

Gated by the `price_variance_enabled` fraud rule (default `true` — set
`settings.fraud_rules.price_variance_enabled: false` to opt out, like the other
fraud rules). Tolerance / escalate / min-history come from the **same**
`settings.enrichment` block the advisory endpoint uses, so the persisted warning
and the inline advisory always agree. Best-effort: a failure in the check is
swallowed (PII-free log) and never blocks saving the invoice. The message
carries only the item label + prices + percent — no vendor PII. Covered by
`backend/tests/test_price_variance_warning.py`. The inline read-only endpoint is
unchanged.

## Vendor performance scoring

`compute_vendor_score(...)` → `VendorScore` (composite + sub-scores). Each
sub-score is `0..100` or **N/A** (`None`, excluded from the composite).

### Accuracy — `(1 - correction_rate) * 100`
Over the vendor's approved-or-beyond invoices that carry an `invoice.approved`
audit row: `correction_rate` = fraction whose approval included field
corrections (`details.changes` non-empty — the same signal
`adaptive_workflows` uses). Counted per **distinct invoice**, not per audit
row — an invoice can carry several `invoice.approved` rows (a rejected →
re-approved cycle, or a voided payment returning it to `approved` and being
re-approved), and an invoice counts as "corrected" if **any** of its approvals
carried changes. `approved_count == 0` → N/A.

### Dispute — `(1 - exception_rate) * 100`
`exception_rate` = distinct vendor invoices that raised a vendor-facing
`Exception` (`po_mismatch`, `duplicate`, `fraud_flag`, `missing_data`) over the
vendor's total invoice count (any status, status-agnostic — friction that
*happened* counts). `total_invoices == 0` → N/A.

### On-time delivery — `received_date <= PurchaseOrder.expected_delivery_date`
**Real on-time delivery, computed from `PurchaseOrder.expected_delivery_date`**
(nullable `Date`, added in **migration 0060** — a tenant-scoped column that fans
out to every tenant DB). Over the vendor's POs that carry **both** an
`expected_delivery_date` **and** a goods receipt (`GoodsReceipt.received_date`),
the sub-score is the fraction received on or before the expected date
(`received_date <= expected_delivery_date`; the boundary day counts as on time).
Deterministic, compute-on-read, evidence-backed (the count rides in `detail`),
no LLM.

A PO with no expected date, or no goods receipt, contributes **nothing** — it is
not counted as on-time *or* late. When **no** PO has both, the sub-score is
honest **N/A** (`null`, `sample_size: 0`, `detail` says so) and is excluded from
the composite — a vendor with no comparable data is never punished, and the math
never divides by zero. This is the authoritative signal and needs no org flag.

`expected_delivery_date` **auto-populates from ERP PO sync**
(`POST /api/purchase-orders/sync-erp`): the unified `PoPayload` carries an
`expected_delivery_date`, the `mock` catalogue emits deterministic dates (with
one PO deliberately left without one, to exercise the "leave None, don't
fabricate" branch end-to-end), and the `merge_dev` adapter maps it from the
upstream `delivery_date` / `expected_delivery_date` / `requested_delivery_date`
field (unparseable values fall back to None — never fabricated, never raises).
The sync mapper sets it on a newly-created PO and **back-fills** it onto an
existing PO only when the ERP supplies a date AND the row doesn't already carry
one — a date already on the row (human-set via the model/API, or a prior sync)
**wins**, and a None payload never erases it. POs are ERP/manual-only (the AI
extraction pipeline creates invoices, not POs), so there is no extraction leg to
wire.

An **opt-in** due-date proxy (org flag `ontime_use_due_date_proxy`, default
`false`) remains as a **weak fallback**, used **only** when the authoritative
expected-date signal finds no comparable POs *and* the flag is on. It
approximates on-time as `received_date <= invoice.due_date` (GR → PO by vendor →
Invoice by `po_number`). The invoice due date is not the delivery-promised date,
so this proxy stays opt-in and its `detail` string says "(due-date proxy)" so it
can never be mistaken for the real signal.

### Composite (renormalized over available sub-scores)
Weights `{accuracy: 0.4, dispute: 0.3, on_time: 0.3}`, renormalized over only
the non-N/A sub-scores so an N/A component drops out cleanly:
`composite = (Σ wᵢ·scoreᵢ for available) / (Σ wᵢ for available)`. With all three
available, `composite = 0.4·accuracy + 0.3·dispute + 0.3·on_time`. When on-time
is N/A (no PO carries both an expected date and a receipt),
`composite = (0.4·accuracy + 0.3·dispute) / 0.7`. `None` when no sub-score is
available.

### Missing-data handling

| Situation | Result |
|---|---|
| Vendor with no invoices at all | all sub-scores N/A, `composite = null`, 200 OK with explanatory `detail`s |
| Invoices but no approvals | accuracy N/A; dispute computed; composite = dispute alone |
| No PO carries both an expected date and a goods receipt | on-time N/A (excluded from the composite) |
| Unknown `vendor_id` | 404 |
| `vendor_id` in another tenant | 404 (tenant-DB scoping makes it not-found, not 403) |

**Compute-on-read.** The score is a deterministic pure function of data already
in the tenant DB (the on-time leg reads `PurchaseOrder.expected_delivery_date`,
added in migration 0060, vs `GoodsReceipt.received_date` — no per-score row is
stored); caching would add a staleness/invalidation
problem (every approval, correction, exception, or GR would have to bump it) for
no correctness gain. The endpoint is on-demand, not a hot list path. If a future
dashboard needs to *sort many vendors by score*, that is the trigger to add a
cached `vendor_scores` column/table (deferred) behind a refresh writer — reusing
the pure scorer unchanged.

## Vendor consolidation (duplicate / similar vendor clusters)

`find_consolidation_clusters(vendors) -> (list[VendorCluster], truncated)` in
`app/services/vendor_consolidation.py`. Pure, sync, DB-free — the API layer
(`app/api/enrichment.py`) pulls a lightweight vendor projection + per-vendor
invoice counts and hands them in as `VendorRecord`s.

Identifies CLUSTERS of likely-duplicate vendors so a steward can dedupe the
master list. The **suggestions** endpoint is **advisory only** — it suggests a
canonical/primary candidate per cluster but NEVER merges or mutates anything.
The separate, explicit **execute** path (`POST
/api/enrichment/vendors/consolidation/merge`, below) is what actually folds a
steward-confirmed cluster into one canonical vendor.

### Evidence + clustering

- Reuses the fuzzy primitives from **`services/vendor_matching.py`** (`_normalize`
  — drops `Inc`/`LLC`/`Ltd`/… suffixes + punctuation; `_similarity` — Jaccard
  token overlap, 0..1), not a reinvented matcher. So `"Acme Supplies Inc."` and
  `"Acme Supplies, LLC"` normalize to the same token bag and cluster.
- A pair clusters on **any** of (strongest first): same normalized `tax_id`
  (score `1.0`, definitive), same normalized `code` (score `0.95`), or fuzzy
  name similarity `>= NAME_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD` (default `0.6`; score = the
  similarity). A tax-id / code match clusters **regardless of name** — a typo'd
  name is exactly the duplicate we want to catch.
- Clustering is **transitive** (union-find): A~B by tax id and B~C by code put
  all three in one cluster even if A and C share no direct evidence — they're
  the same vendor seen three ways.
- Only `active` / `unverified` vendors are scanned — consolidating the *live*
  master list is the point; `inactive` / `rejected` rows are already handled.

### Canonical pick (deterministic)

Per cluster: **most invoice volume** wins; tie → **oldest** (lowest `age_rank`,
the caller's `created_at asc` row index); final tie → lowest id (stable). The
canonical member sorts first in `members`; the rest follow by invoice volume
desc. Two runs over the same data return byte-identical output.

### Performance bound (no silent O(n²))

Vendors are first partitioned into **blocks** by a cheap key — exact normalized
`tax_id`, exact normalized `code`, and the normalized name's **first token** —
and the quadratic fuzzy comparison runs only *within* a block. Two vendors are
compared only if they already share one of those keys, collapsing the worst case
from N² to Σ(block size)². A hard `MAX_VENDORS` (5000) backstop skips clustering
entirely above the cap (`truncated=true`, no clusters); `MAX_CLUSTERS` (200)
caps the emitted clusters (strongest first, tail dropped → `truncated=true`).

### PII

A vendor's full `tax_id` never leaves the service or enters a response / log.
The clustering hashes the **normalized** tax id internally to bucket and to
decide "same tax id", but only a masked `***<last4>` (`mask_tax_id`) is emitted
on each member.

## Endpoints

All three are auth + RBAC gated and tenant-scoped (`get_tenant_db` + entity scope).

### `POST /api/enrichment/vendors/consolidation/merge`
Permission: `vendor.manage` (admin / ap_manager by default — vendor master-data
control is a splittable SoD duty, gated by `require_permission`, not
`require_roles`). The **execute** counterpart of the advisory suggestions
endpoint: the steward confirms a cluster and merges it.

```json
// request
{"canonical_vendor_id": "…", "duplicate_vendor_ids": ["…", "…"]}
// response
{
  "canonical_vendor_id": "…",
  "duplicate_vendor_ids": ["…", "…"],
  "reassigned": {"invoices": 2, "purchase_orders": 1, "credit_memos": 1},
  "total_reassigned": 4,
  "deactivated_vendor_ids": ["…", "…"],
  "merged_at": "2026-06-20T…Z"
}
```

What the merge does, in one tenant transaction (`app/services/vendor_merge.py`):

- **Reassigns every `vendor_id` FK** across every tenant child table from each
  duplicate → the canonical vendor (one bounded `UPDATE` per table). The full
  set is `VENDOR_FK_CHILDREN` — invoices, purchase orders, credit memos,
  contracts, discount offers, recurring templates, statement reconciliations,
  virtual cards, sanctions checks, vendor change requests, vendor users, invoice
  embeddings, workflow suggestions, catalogs / catalog items, purchase
  requisitions, intake requests — **the single source of truth for "what points
  at a vendor"**; a new table with a `vendor_id` FK MUST be added there or its
  rows orphan on a merge. `VendorExtractionPrior` is handled specially — see
  **Extraction priors** below.
- **Collapses the extraction priors** — `vendor_extraction_priors` is uniquely
  keyed on `(vendor_id, field_name)`, so a blind reassign would violate the
  constraint two different ways: where the *canonical* already holds a prior for
  the same field, **and** where two *duplicates* each hold one for a field the
  canonical lacks (the second row reassigned collides with the first). The merge
  therefore collapses the whole canonical ∪ duplicates prior set first, so at
  most ONE prior per `field_name` survives onto the canonical:
  - the **canonical's own prior wins its field outright** — it is the surviving
    vendor and its value is the one already biasing extractions;
  - where the canonical has none, the duplicates compete and the
    **most-evidenced** prior wins: highest `correction_count`, then applied
    before never-applied / most recent `last_applied_at`, then most recent
    `updated_at`, then lowest id. That last key makes the order *total*, so the
    winner is deterministic — merging the same vendors twice always keeps the
    same prior, and a re-run of a completed merge is a clean no-op.

  Losers are **deleted**, not merged: a prior is a derived extraction-bias cache
  rebuilt from future reviewer corrections — no money, no history. The dropped
  count surfaces on the result (and the audit row) as
  `vendor_extraction_priors:dropped`.
- **Soft-retires each duplicate** (`status="inactive"`) — never hard-deleted, so
  the historical vendor row + its audit trail survive. (A retired duplicate is
  also already excluded from future consolidation scans, which only see
  `active` / `unverified`.)
- **Row-locks** the canonical + every duplicate (`SELECT … FOR UPDATE`, id order)
  so two concurrent merges can't interleave.
- **Idempotent** — a re-run with the FKs already moved and the duplicates already
  inactive reassigns zero rows and re-deactivates nothing (200, empty counts).
- **Audited** — a PII-free `vendor.merged` audit row on the canonical vendor
  (canonical id + duplicate ids + per-table reassigned counts; no `tax_id` /
  bank / address).
- **Refusals** — self-merge (canonical in the duplicate set) and an empty
  duplicate set → 422; an unknown vendor → 404; a **cross-entity** merge
  (canonical and a duplicate in different entities) → 422 (folding across
  entities would silently re-home another subsidiary's spend).

### Frontend UI

The **"Merge into canonical" UI now ships** on `/vendors`. A **Merge duplicates**
header action (visible only when `auth.can('vendor.manage')` — the same granular
permission the endpoint enforces, NOT a role check) opens
`$lib/components/modals/VendorConsolidationModal.svelte`, which fetches
`consolidation-suggestions` and renders each cluster as a canonical-vs-duplicate
diff table (name / code / masked tax ID / status / invoice count / role, with the
clustering `reasons` as pills). A per-cluster **Merge into canonical** button uses
a two-step arm → **Confirm merge** (the fold is soft-retire-irreversible), calls
`/consolidation/merge` for that cluster's duplicate ids, drops the merged cluster
from the list, surfaces the backend's 4xx detail (self-merge / cross-entity /
unknown) in the failure toast, and refreshes the vendor list. API client +
types: `$lib/api/vendors.ts` (`getVendorConsolidationSuggestions` /
`mergeVendorConsolidation`) + `$lib/types/vendor.ts`. e2e:
`frontend/tests-e2e/vendors/consolidation-merge.spec.ts` (seeds a duplicate pair
sharing a tax id, merges, asserts the duplicate goes `inactive`; plus a clerk who
never sees the action).

## External enrichment (D&B / Clearbit)

The four surfaces above are derived from the tenant's own history. **External
enrichment** instead looks a vendor up in a third-party firmographics provider
(Dun & Bradstreet, Clearbit) and returns a normalised record — legal name,
registered address, country, industry + SIC/NAICS, employee count, annual
revenue, website, DUNS, founding year — so an AP steward can review and
selectively apply it. It is built as a **pluggable adapter family**
(`services/enrichment_adapters/`) following the project's local-first adapter
pattern (the same shape as `sanctions_adapters` / `fx_adapters` /
`billing_adapters`).

### Adapters

| Provider | Network / key | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| `mock` (default) | none | Deterministic synthetic firmographics from a hash of the vendor name (legal name carries a `(MOCK)` marker so it can't be mistaken for real data). A built-in no-match fixture set + a `mock_no_match` override exercise the "couldn't enrich" branch. Local-first — `pnpm dev` + the whole test suite run against it with no cloud account. |
| `dun_bradstreet` | `httpx` to D&B Direct+ | Skeleton — `cleanseMatch` (resolve to a DUNS) → `data/duns/{duns}` firmographics block, request/response shapes match the published API. **Fails closed** (`EnrichmentNotConfigured`) without a per-org `api_key`; no hardcoded fallback secret. |
| `clearbit` | `httpx` to Clearbit Company API | Skeleton — domain-keyed `companies/find`. A vendor with no email-derived domain is a clean no-match (not an error). **Fails closed** without a per-org `api_key`. |

Registry via the `@register_enrichment_adapter` decorator;
`get_enrichment_adapter(config)` resolves per-org
`Organization.settings.enrichment.provider` → the `AP_VENDOR_ENRICHMENT_PROVIDER`
env default (`mock`). An unknown provider name falls back to `mock` (a typo can't
break enrichment), but the real providers still fail closed on a missing key.

To add a provider: copy `mock_adapter.py`, implement `enrich_vendor` +
`test_connection`, register with the decorator.

### `POST /api/enrichment/vendors/{vendor_id}/enrich`

Roles: `admin`, `ap_manager`, `cfo` (managerial data-stewardship action that may
consume a metered external API — clerk excluded, like the score + consolidation
surfaces). Tenant-scoped via `get_tenant_db` + `get_tenant`.

**Advisory / suggestion-only — never overwrites.** The response carries the
looked-up firmographics plus a per-field `suggestions` diff (where the provider's
value differs from what we hold today); the enrichment path **never writes back
onto the `Vendor` row**. Applying a suggestion is a separate, explicit step
([`POST .../apply`](#post-apienrichmentvendorsvendor_idapply) below), mirroring
the consolidation surface's "suggest a canonical, never merge" stance.

**PII.** A vendor's raw `tax_id` is passed to a provider as a match key (an input
only) but is **never echoed back** — only a masked `***<last4>` (`mask_tax_id`,
reused from `vendor_consolidation`) ever appears in the response, and no PII
enters a log line. A keyless real provider returns a PII-free 422 (the message
names only the missing `api_key`, never a secret).

```json
{
  "vendor_id": "…",
  "vendor_name": "Acme Supplies",
  "firmographics": {
    "provider": "mock", "matched": true,
    "legal_name": "Acme Supplies (MOCK)", "address": "1 Mock Plaza, Suite 100",
    "country": "US", "industry": "Commercial Printing", "sic_code": "2752",
    "naics_code": "323111", "employee_count": 1828, "annual_revenue": "457000000",
    "website": "https://acmesupplies.example", "duns_number": "388666768",
    "year_founded": 1982, "tax_id_masked": "***6789", "confidence": 88,
    "extra": {"source": "mock", "deterministic": true}
  },
  "suggestions": [
    {"field": "address", "current_value": null, "suggested_value": "1 Mock Plaza, Suite 100"}
  ],
  "generated_at": "2026-06-20T…Z"
}
```

`annual_revenue` is a **string** on the wire (never a float — money invariant).

### `POST /api/enrichment/vendors/{vendor_id}/apply`

Roles: `admin`, `ap_manager`, `cfo` (the same managerial set as `enrich` —
matches who can mutate vendors today). Tenant-scoped via `get_tenant_db` +
`get_tenant`.

Applies a steward-selected set of enrichment suggestions onto the `Vendor` row
through an **audited write**. This is the explicit "apply" counterpart to the
advisory `enrich` endpoint — the caller passes EXACTLY which fields to write
(picked from the enrich diff), so the apply is **non-destructive**: only the
named fields change, never a silent overwrite of everything.

```json
// request
{ "fields": [
    { "field": "address", "value": "1 Mock Plaza, Suite 100" },
    { "field": "website", "value": "https://acmesupplies.example" }
] }
// response
{
  "vendor_id": "…",
  "applied": {
    "address": { "old": null, "new": "1 Mock Plaza, Suite 100" },
    "website": { "old": null, "new": "https://acmesupplies.example" }
  },
  "vendor": { /* full VendorResponse after the write */ },

```

- **Applyable fields** (`APPLYABLE_FIELDS` in `api/enrichment.py`): `name`
  (← provider `legal_name`), `address`, `website`. **`website` is a real column
  as of migration 0061** (`vendors.website`, nullable `varchar(500)`,
  tenant-scoped, fans out to every tenant DB) — until then the website
  suggestion was surfaced but had nowhere to land.
- **`tax_id` is NEVER applyable here.** A tax-id change is a fraud surface; it
  must go through the existing **bank/tax change-request gate**
  (`/api/vendors/change-requests/...`, AP-approval-staged), never an enrichment
  auto-apply. A request naming `tax_id` (or any unknown / non-applyable field)
  is rejected **422** (fail closed — the caller learns it didn't land rather
  than having it silently dropped). `name` cannot be blanked (it's NOT NULL).
- **Audited (invariant #3).** A genuine change writes a `vendor.updated`
  `audit_log` row with the field-level before/after diff (via the same
  `build_field_diff` the vendor PATCH uses) and `details.source =
  "enrichment_apply"`. The applyable fields are PII-free, so the diff records
  their literal old/new values.
- **Idempotent.** Re-applying the same value produces no diff → no spurious
  audit row (200 with an empty `applied` map). Driven by `build_field_diff`
  emitting only genuinely-changed fields.

## Config (org settings, all safe defaults — no key required)

Optional overrides under `Organization.settings.enrichment` (merge-over-defaults;
unknown keys dropped, numeric coercion guarded — like `_adaptive_settings`):

| Key | Default |
|---|---|
| `autofill_min_confidence` | `60.0` |
| `autofill_min_sample` | `3` |
| `price_tolerance_pct` | `15.0` |
| `price_escalate_pct` | `30.0` |
| `price_min_history` | `2` |
| `ontime_use_due_date_proxy` | `false` |

## Deferred follow-ups

- ~~**Persist price variance** into `invoice_warnings.refresh_warnings` (+ raise an
  `Exception`)~~ — **DONE.** `_refresh_price_variance` reuses the pure
  `detect_price_variance` at the `refresh_warnings` chokepoint; see the Price
  variance section above.
- ~~**PO expected-date column** to make on-time delivery real~~ — **DONE.**
  Migration 0060 adds the nullable `PurchaseOrder.expected_delivery_date`
  (tenant-scoped, fans out to every tenant DB); the on-time sub-score is now
  computed from `received_date <= expected_delivery_date` and folds into the
  composite at weight 0.3. See [§ On-time delivery](#on-time-delivery--received_date--purchaseorderexpected_delivery_date)
  above. Remaining: the extraction / PO-ingest path does not yet populate
  `expected_delivery_date` automatically — it is set via the model/API today;
  wiring it into ERP PO sync + AI extraction is a follow-up (until a PO carries
  the date, that PO simply doesn't contribute to the on-time sample).
- **Cached `vendor_scores` table** for multi-vendor sorting (trigger: a
  sort-by-score dashboard); reuses the pure scorer behind a refresh writer.
- ~~**External enrichment** (D&B / Clearbit)~~ — **DONE.** Built as a pluggable
  adapter family with a deterministic `mock` default (local-first preserved) +
  fail-closed `dun_bradstreet` / `clearbit` skeletons. See
  [§ External enrichment](#external-enrichment-db--clearbit). Remaining:
  - ~~**Apply a suggestion**~~ — **DONE.**
    [`POST /api/enrichment/vendors/{id}/apply`](#post-apienrichmentvendorsvendor_idapply)
    writes a steward-selected set of fields (`name` / `address` / `website`)
    onto the `Vendor` through an audited, idempotent, non-destructive path.
    Migration 0061 added the `Vendor.website` column (tenant-scoped, fans out) so
    the website suggestion can land. `tax_id` is intentionally excluded — it
    goes through the bank/tax change-request gate, never an enrichment
    auto-apply. Remaining: an "Apply" action in the vendor-detail UI (frontend).
  - **Live D&B / Clearbit calls** — the real adapters are working skeletons
    (request/response shapes match the published APIs) but need a live key wired
    via sops per-org before they call out; until then they fail closed.
- **Consolidation merge (execute)** — SHIPPED end-to-end: `POST
  /api/enrichment/vendors/consolidation/merge` re-points every `vendor_id` FK to
  the canonical vendor, soft-retires the duplicates, is idempotent + audited (see
  the endpoint below), and the **"Merge into canonical" UI now ships** on
  `/vendors` (the `vendor.manage`-gated **Merge duplicates** modal — see
  [§ Frontend UI](#frontend-ui)).
- **Amount-deviation flagging** already shipped in
  `adaptive_workflows.detect_invoice_anomaly` — intentionally **not** duplicated.
