# Public Developer API & Webhooks

Programmatic, versioned access to the platform for external integrators —
authenticated with per-org **API keys** (not the SPA's JWT session). The first
slice shipped API-key auth + key management + a small read-only `/api/v1`
surface; the second shipped **outbound webhooks** (see [Outbound
webhooks](#outbound-webhooks)); the third shipped the **published, versioned
OpenAPI spec + a developer docs page** for the `/api/v1` surface (see
[Published OpenAPI spec](#published-openapi-spec) and [Versioning &
deprecation policy](#versioning--deprecation-policy)).

## Auth model

| Surface | Auth | Header |
|---------|------|--------|
| `/api/v1/*` (programmatic) | API key | `X-API-Key: feoh_live_…` |
| `/api/api-keys/*` (key management) | JWT session + `admin` role | `Authorization: Bearer …` + `X-Tenant-Slug` |

A programmatic request carries **no** `X-Tenant-Slug` header and **no** JWT — the
**API key IS the tenant boundary**. The key resolves to its `Organization` in the
control plane, and the org resolves to its tenant DB via the same
`get_tenant_engine(org.db_name)` chokepoint the JWT path uses
(`app/api/deps.py::get_api_key_db`). So every `/api/v1` read is tenant-isolated at
the data layer — there is no header a caller can swap to widen access.

### Why API keys are SHA-256, not bcrypt

API keys are high-entropy random tokens (`secrets.token_urlsafe(32)`), not
user-chosen passwords. They must be **looked up** by the value the caller
presents, and a salted bcrypt hash (the `bcrypt_sha256` password context) is
deliberately un-indexable — you'd have to scan every row and bcrypt-verify each.
So the platform stores an **unsalted `sha256(full_key)`** digest plus an indexed
`key_prefix`, resolves the candidate row(s) by prefix, then **constant-time
compares** the digest (`hmac.compare_digest`). This is the identical pattern the
SCIM bearer token already uses (`Organization.scim_bearer_hash`,
`services/sso.generate_scim_token`). The `bcrypt_sha256` project invariant is the
**password** path; brute-forcing a 256-bit random token is infeasible, so an
unsalted SHA-256 is appropriate here. Rationale is also captured in a code comment
in `app/models/api_key.py` and `app/services/api_keys.py` so a reviewer doesn't
flag it.

## Key lifecycle

| Step | Endpoint | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Mint | `POST /api/api-keys` (admin) | Body `{ "name": "reporting-bot" }`. Returns the **plaintext key exactly once** in `key`, plus metadata in `api_key`. Audited `api_key.created` (PII-free: prefix + name + scopes). |
| List | `GET /api/api-keys` (admin) | Metadata only — prefix, scopes, timestamps. **Never** the hash or plaintext. |
| Usage | `GET /api/api-keys/{id}/usage?window_days=30` (admin) | Per-key request totals (counts only) from the `api_key_usage` meter — all-time `total_requests`, trailing-`window_days` `window_requests`, `last_used_at`, and a per-day `daily` breakdown. Org-scoped (wrong-org id → opaque 404, same as revoke). **Never** the hash or plaintext. |
| Revoke | `DELETE /api/api-keys/{id}` (admin) | Soft revoke (`revoked_at` stamped; row kept for audit). Idempotent. Audited `api_key.revoked`. |

- **Plaintext shown once.** The mint response is the only place the full key ever
  appears. It is never stored or logged — only `key_hash` + `key_prefix` persist.
- **Format.** `feoh_live_<43 url-safe chars>`. The stable `feoh_live` brand makes a
  leaked key recognisable to secret-scanners and greppable.
- **Scopes.** This slice mints `["read"]` only. The `scopes` column is JSONB and
  each route is gated by `require_api_scope(...)`, so a future write surface
  inherits enforcement without a migration.
- **`last_used_at`.** Stamped best-effort on every successful auth (its own
  session; a failure there never breaks a valid request).

### Per-key usage metering

Every authenticated `/api/v1` request increments a **per-key, per-day** counter
so usage is queryable for the billing track and for an admin "how busy is this
key" read. The store is the aggregate `api_key_usage` table — one row per
`(api_key_id, usage_date)` holding a running `request_count` — not a per-request
log: aggregation keeps the write a single `INSERT … ON CONFLICT … DO UPDATE`
increment and the read a cheap rollup, and it stores **no** request payloads or
PII (only counts + a UTC day).

The increment rides the **same** best-effort write the `last_used_at` stamp does,
on the `get_api_key_principal` auth path (the upsert + the `last_used_at` UPDATE
are one commit on the request-scoped control session — see `app/api/deps.py::
_record_api_key_usage`). **Metering is best-effort:** if the usage write fails it
is swallowed with a PII-free warning (the key id only, never the key material)
and the request proceeds — a meter failure never breaks an otherwise valid
authenticated call. Reads land via `GET /api/api-keys/{id}/usage` (above).

### Per-key rate limiting

Every authenticated `/api/v1` request is rate-limited **per API key** by the
existing Redis sliding-window limiter (`services/rate_limit.py`), keyed on the
`api_key_id` (not per-IP, not per-org — one key flooding the API can't lock out
another key, even within the same org). The cap is
`FEOH_PUBLIC_API_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE` (default **120 req/min**) over a fixed
**60-second** window. A key over its cap gets an
**HTTP `429 Too Many Requests`** with a **`Retry-After`** header (seconds until
the oldest in-window request ages out).

Ordering matters for non-enumeration: the limit is checked **after** the key
authenticates, inside `get_api_key_principal` (just before the principal is
returned). An unauthenticated / garbage / revoked key short-circuits on the
opaque `401` above and never reaches the limiter — so a `429` only ever confirms
a **valid** key that is over its limit, never that a key exists.

**Fails open on a Redis outage.** The limiter raises `RateLimitExceeded` (the
429) which is allowed to propagate, but any *other* failure in the check — e.g.
Redis unreachable — is swallowed with a PII-free warning (the key id only) and
the request proceeds. A Redis blip must not deny otherwise-valid authenticated
API access; this matches the best-effort posture of the adjacent usage meter.
The limiter is also gated by the global `FEOH_RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED` master switch
(CI's e2e suite flips it off).

### Failure mode

Every API-key failure (missing header, unknown prefix, bad digest, revoked key,
or the platform kill switch `FEOH_PUBLIC_API_ENABLED=false`) returns the **same
opaque `401 {"detail": "Invalid API key"}`** with `WWW-Authenticate: ApiKey`.
Distinct messages would let a caller enumerate which keys/prefixes exist. A
foreign / missing invoice id on `GET /api/v1/invoices/{id}` is a `404` — and a
key for tenant A literally cannot see tenant B's row (the session is bound to A's
DB), so a cross-tenant id is simply "not found", never leaked.

## `/api/v1` read surface

All routes are behind `require_api_scope("read")` (→ `get_api_key_principal`)
**and** `require_api_entitlement("public_api")` — the public API is a
paid-plan feature, 402 without it — and read through `get_api_key_db` (the
tenant session resolved from the key).

**Local dev:** a freshly provisioned org (including the two demo tenants,
`scripts/seed.py`) starts on the `free` plan, which does not grant
`public_api` — so `/api/v1` 402s out of the box, by design. Unlock it locally
with no cloud account by upgrading via `POST /api/billing/change-plan
{"plan_code": "growth"}` (the `mock` billing adapter handles this with no
Stripe key). See `docs/billing.md` § Default plan catalog + baseline
Subscription and § Entitlement gating.

| Method | Path | Returns |
|--------|------|---------|
| `GET` | `/api/v1/invoices` | Paginated list. Query: `status`, `page` (≥1), `page_size` (1–200). Shape `{ data: [V1Invoice], page, page_size, total }`. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/invoices/{id}` | One `V1Invoice`; `404` if not found in this tenant. |

`V1Invoice` (`app/schemas/public_v1.py`) is a **stable, curated subset** of the
internal `Invoice` ORM model — adding an internal column does **not** change the
v1 response; fields must be added here explicitly. **Money (`amount`) serialises
as a JSON string** (e.g. `"123.45"`) so external clients get exact arithmetic
with no float rounding — stricter than the SPA-facing `MoneyAmount` type, which
emits a JSON number. The value is `Decimal` end to end in Python (money-is-exact
invariant).

```
V1Invoice = { id, invoice_number, vendor_name, amount, currency,
              status, invoice_date, due_date, created_at }
```

## Published OpenAPI spec

The `/api/v1` surface ships a **published, versioned OpenAPI document** — the
machine-readable contract integrators code (and generate clients) against.

| Method | Path | Returns |
|--------|------|---------|
| `GET` | `/api/v1/openapi.json` | The OpenAPI 3.1 document for the public surface (JSON). |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/docs` | A human-readable HTML reference rendered from that spec. |

Both are **public** (no `X-API-Key` needed to *read the contract*) but both
respect the `FEOH_PUBLIC_API_ENABLED` kill switch: when the public API is off they
`404` — the surface, and therefore its contract, is simply not there. The 404
(rather than a distinct "disabled") matches the opaque-failure posture of the
data routes.

### Why `/v1/docs` is not Swagger UI

It used to be. `get_swagger_ui_html`'s only stylesheet, script and favicon are
third-party CDN URLs (`cdn.jsdelivr.net`, `fastapi.tiangolo.com`), while
`main.SecurityHeadersMiddleware` stamps `Content-Security-Policy: default-src
'none'` on every response — so the route returned `200`, fetched nothing, and
**rendered blank** in any browser honouring the header.

Three exits were considered:

1. **Vendor `swagger-ui-dist`** and serve it from our own origin. Keeps the CSP
   strict and works offline, but commits ~1 MB of third-party JavaScript to a
   public repo plus a version nobody will remember to bump — a supply-chain
   artifact acquired for a reference page.
2. **Allowlist the CDN** in a route-scoped CSP. Three lines, but it gives a page
   the platform serves a third-party runtime dependency, and it *still* renders
   blank offline — breaking guard rail 7 (local-first).
3. **Drop the route** and point integrators at the spec URL. Honest, but a 404
   on a URL these docs advertise is its own defect.

What shipped is (1) taken to its minimum: `v1_openapi.render_docs_html` renders
the same document server-side as self-contained HTML — **no script at all** and
no external asset of any kind. The route sets its own CSP,
`default-src 'none'; style-src 'unsafe-inline'; frame-ancestors 'none'; base-uri
'none'`, which differs from the global policy by exactly one token (the page's
own inline stylesheet, which can neither execute nor exfiltrate).

The **global** CSP is deliberately untouched — it is what keeps the API origin
unable to load third-party script at all, and relaxing it for one page would
relax it for every JSON response too. `SecurityHeadersMiddleware` uses
`setdefault`, so a route-set header wins without any middleware change.

Trade-off, stated plainly: this is a **reference, not an interactive console** —
there is no "Try it out". The machine-readable contract at
`/api/v1/openapi.json` is what integrators actually consume, and it feeds any
client generator or Swagger/Redoc instance they already run. `render_docs_html`
is a pure function of the spec, so the page can't drift from the routes.

Guards: `tests/test_public_api_openapi.py` asserts the page references no
third-party host, contains no `<script>` or `<link>`, sets the strict
route-scoped CSP, leaves the global policy on `/openapi.json` unchanged, escapes
spec text, and renders an empty spec without raising.

**Scoped, not the whole app.** The spec is generated from the *live* FastAPI
route table (so it can never drift from the routes) but then filtered to the
`/api/v1` paths only and overlaid with a curated security scheme + servers +
version (`app/api/v1_openapi.py::build_public_openapi`). The internal SPA API
(`/api/auth`, `/api/invoices`, `/api/payments`, …) is **never** described here,
and component schemas are pruned to those reachable from the v1 routes — an
internal-only Pydantic model can't leak into the public contract via an orphan.

What the document carries:

- `info.version: "v1"` — the contract version (tracks the path prefix).
- A `servers` entry built from `FEOH_API_PUBLIC_URL`, so generated clients target
  the right base URL.
- A single `ApiKeyAuth` security scheme (`apiKey` in the `X-API-Key` header),
  applied **globally** — every operation shows the auth requirement.
- The published `V1Invoice` / `V1InvoiceList` component schemas, with `amount`
  typed as a **string** (money-is-exact — exact arithmetic over JSON, no float),
  and the `status` / `page` / `page_size` pagination parameters on the list
  operation.

The route mount is additive in `app/main.py` (`public_v1_openapi_router`); the
generator is pure with respect to the app (reads routes, returns a fresh dict),
so it's safe to build per request.

## Versioning & deprecation policy

The `/api/v1` surface carries an explicit stability contract so integrators can
build against it safely:

- **Versioning is in the path.** A new major version is a new prefix
  (`/api/v2`), served alongside `/api/v1` with its own `openapi.json` + `docs`.
  The `info.version` string tracks the prefix.
- **`v1` is additive-only.** Within `v1` we may **add** optional response fields,
  new endpoints, and new optional query params. We will **not** remove or rename
  a documented field, change its type (e.g. `amount` stays a string), narrow an
  enum, or make an optional param required — those are breaking changes and
  require a new version. The `V1Invoice` schema is decoupled from the internal
  ORM precisely so an internal column change never silently alters the contract.
- **Deprecation window.** When a version is slated for sunset, it is announced in
  this doc and (where applicable) flagged via the standard `Deprecation` /
  `Sunset` response headers and `deprecated: true` in the OpenAPI operation. A
  deprecated version is supported for **at least 6 months** after the
  announcement before removal, with the successor version available for the whole
  window so integrators can migrate.
- **The kill switch is not a deprecation.** `FEOH_PUBLIC_API_ENABLED=false` is an
  operational stop (incident response), not a contract change; it 404s the whole
  surface immediately and uniformly.

## Config

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `FEOH_PUBLIC_API_ENABLED` | `true` | Platform kill switch for the `/api/v1` surface — the read routes **and** the published spec/docs (`/api/v1/openapi.json`, `/api/v1/docs`). The surface is auth-gated regardless; when `false` every key fails closed with the opaque 401 and the spec/docs 404. No secret — API keys are minted per-org and stored hashed. |
| `FEOH_PUBLIC_API_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE` | `120` | Per-API-key request cap on `/api/v1`, over a fixed 60-second window, enforced by the Redis sliding-window limiter keyed on `api_key_id`. A key over its cap gets a 429 + `Retry-After`. Checked after the key authenticates (a bad key still gets the opaque 401, never a 429). Fails open on a Redis outage; gated by the global `FEOH_RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED` master switch. No secret. |

There is no API-key secret in config or `.env` — each key is generated at mint
time and only its hash persists, so the secrets-via-sops / no-hardcoded-fallback
rule has nothing to hold here.

## Data model

`ApiKey` (control plane, table `api_keys`, migration **0055**, added to
`CONTROL_TABLES`): `id`, `organization_id` (FK), `name`, `key_prefix` (indexed),
`key_hash` (sha256 hex), `scopes` (JSONB), `last_used_at`, `revoked_at`,
`created_at`/`updated_at`. Control-plane-only migration (gated on the
`organizations` table existing — mirrors `0021_scim_bearer_hash`); it does **not**
fan out to tenant DBs.

`ApiKeyUsage` (control plane, table `api_key_usage`, migration **0058**, added to
`CONTROL_TABLES`): `id`, `api_key_id` (FK, `ON DELETE CASCADE`),
`organization_id` (FK — denormalised so a billing rollup can `GROUP BY` org
without joining `api_keys`), `usage_date` (UTC day), `request_count`
(`BigInteger`, exact), `created_at`/`updated_at`. Unique on
`(api_key_id, usage_date)` (`uq_api_key_usage_key_day`) — the upsert target for
the per-request increment. Control-plane-only migration (gated on `organizations`
existing — mirrors `0055`); it does **not** fan out to tenant DBs, and a
control-plane-only change needs no `migrate_all_tenants.py` run.

## Outbound webhooks

The push counterpart of the `/api/v1` pull surface: an org's integrator
subscribes to platform events, and the platform POSTs a **signed** JSON payload
to the subscriber URL when an event fires — bounded retries, dead-letter, and a
redelivery endpoint. Mirrors the inbound-webhook discipline (sign + dedupe).

### Data model (control plane)

Both tables live in the **control plane** keyed by `organization_id` — the SAME
placement as `api_keys` (an outbound webhook is the push counterpart of the
programmatic surface; a subscription belongs to an org, not a tenant DB). Added
to `tenant_provisioning.CONTROL_TABLES`. Migration **0057** (control-plane-only,
gated on the `organizations` table existing — mirrors 0055).

- **`webhook_subscriptions`** — `id`, `organization_id`, `name`, `target_url`
  (http(s)), `event_types` (JSONB subset of the catalog), `signing_secret`,
  `secret_prefix`, `active`, timestamps.
- **`webhook_deliveries`** — `id`, `subscription_id` (FK, `ON DELETE CASCADE`),
  `organization_id`, `event_id`, `event_type`, `payload` (JSONB, frozen at emit),
  `status` (`pending`/`delivered`/`failed`/`dead`), `attempt_count`,
  `next_attempt_at`, `last_attempt_at`, `response_code`. Unique on
  `(subscription_id, event_id)` (`uq_webhook_delivery_sub_event`) — the dedupe
  guard so a re-fired/replayed event can't queue the same delivery twice. Note
  what that makes `event_id`: an **occurrence** identity, never a bare entity id
  (see § The event id identifies the OCCURRENCE, not the entity).

### Event catalog

`invoice.approved`, `payment.settled`, `exception.raised` (see
`app/models/webhook.py::WEBHOOK_EVENT_TYPES`). The catalog is plain strings, so
adding one needs no migration.

### Signing

Each subscription has its own HMAC-SHA256 **signing secret**, generated at
create time (`whsec_<…>`) and returned to the admin **exactly once** (like an
API-key mint). It is stored verbatim because the dispatcher must sign with it —
an HMAC verification key is *symmetric* by definition (the same trade-off the
per-tenant inbound webhook secrets make). List/get responses carry only
`secret_prefix`, never the full secret. The signature is the exact
`webhook_security.verify_hmac_sha256` primitive (HMAC-SHA256 over the raw body,
hex digest), sent in `X-Webhook-Signature`; the receiver re-derives it the same
way. Headers also carry `X-Webhook-Event-Id` + `X-Webhook-Event-Type` so the
receiver can dedupe.

### Rotating a signing secret

`POST /api/webhooks/{id}/rotate-secret` mints a replacement and returns it
**once**, keeping the subscription id — and therefore its whole delivery
history. Before this existed, the only remedy for a leaked secret was
`DELETE` + re-create, which CASCADE-deletes every delivery row: recovering from
a leak meant destroying the record of what had been delivered.

The awkward part is the instant in between. With one signature header you
cannot satisfy a receiver still configured with the old secret and one already
holding the new one, so a rotation opens a bounded **overlap window**:

| Header | When | Signed with |
|---|---|---|
| `X-Webhook-Signature` | always | the **current** secret |
| `X-Webhook-Signature-Previous` | only while the window is open | the **retiring** secret |

The primary header is always the live key, so an existing receiver's contract
never changes meaning.

**Receiver-side procedure — do step 1 before you ever need to rotate:**

1. Make verification accept **either** header (match the body's HMAC against
   your configured secret, and treat a match on either as valid). This is
   additive and a no-op while no rotation is in flight.
2. `POST /api/webhooks/{id}/rotate-secret` — default overlap
   `60` minutes, max `1440`. Copy the returned secret.
3. Install the new secret in your receiver. Deliveries keep verifying via the
   secondary header throughout.
4. When the window elapses the secondary header simply stops being sent. No
   second call is needed.

A receiver that skips step 1 and reads only the primary header is no worse off
than a hard swap: it pastes the new secret and its downtime is bounded by how
fast it does so.

**`overlap_minutes: 0` is a deliberate hard cutover** — the right choice when
the secret is known-compromised and must stop verifying on the very next
delivery. Out-of-range values are refused (`422`) rather than clamped: silently
shortening a window drops deliveries the caller relied on, and silently
lengthening one keeps a key they wanted dead alive.

The expiry rule lives in one place, `webhooks/rotation.previous_secret_if_live`,
read by both the dispatcher and the API: a previous secret signs only when both
columns are set **and** the expiry is still in the future, so a half-written or
never-cleaned row can't leave a retired key signing. Columns are
`previous_signing_secret` / `previous_secret_expires_at` (migration `0084`,
control-plane only). The audit row (`webhook_subscription.secret_rotated`)
records the prefix and the window — never either secret.

### Payload

```jsonc
{ "id": "invoice.approved:<occurrence-id>", "type": "invoice.approved",
  "created_at": "<iso8601>", "organization_id": "<org-id>",
  "data": { "invoice_id": "…", "invoice_number": "…", "vendor_name": "…",
            "amount": "123.45", "currency": "USD", "status": "approved" } }
```

#### The event id identifies the OCCURRENCE, not the entity

`<occurrence-id>` is a fresh id minted by `workflow_engine.transition_invoice`
for the transition it just committed — **not** the invoice id. An invoice
reaches `approved` more than once (`POST /api/payments/{id}/void` takes a paid
invoice back to `approved`) and `paid` more than once (a later run re-pays it),
and the integrator has to hear about each one.

Keyed on the invoice, the second occurrence was permanently undeliverable: the
`(subscription_id, event_id)` unique index rejected the insert and the emitter
skipped it silently (then via a caught `IntegrityError`; now via
`ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` — see § Services) — and even with the index gone,
the payload `id` would still repeat, so a conforming receiver deduping on
`X-Webhook-Event-Id` would drop it too. The customer's ERP was never told the
invoice had been voided and re-paid.

Re-emitting the SAME occurrence (same id) still collapses to one delivery — that
is what makes a replay safe. `exception.raised` is unaffected: an exception row's
id is already occurrence-unique, since a re-raised exception is a new row.

`exception.raised` carries the exception classification plus the same invoice
metadata (and a deep link):

```jsonc
{ "id": "exception.raised:<exception-id>", "type": "exception.raised",
  "created_at": "<iso8601>", "organization_id": "<org-id>",
  "data": { "exception_id": "…", "exception_type": "duplicate",
            "severity": "warning", "status": "open",
            "invoice_id": "…", "invoice_number": "…", "vendor_name": "…",
            "amount": "123.45", "currency": "USD", "link": "/invoices/<id>" } }
```

The `id` (and thus the dedupe `event_id`) is `exception.raised:<exception-id>`,
so a re-fire / replay of the same exception delivers once. An invoice-less
exception (e.g. a Positive Pay never-issued cheque) carries `invoice_id` /
`invoice_number` / `vendor_name` / `amount` as `null` and `link: "/exceptions"`.

`amount` is an **exact JSON string** (money-is-exact), not a float. Payloads are
PII-free — invoice/exception metadata only, no bank/tax/PAN fields.

### Dispatch + retry + dead-letter

`services/webhooks/` (new package):

- **emit** (`dispatch.emit_event`) — the single chokepoint the event sources
  call. Opens its OWN short-lived control-plane session (the caller's session is
  tenant-scoped), inserts one `WebhookDelivery(status=pending)` per matching
  active subscription in a **single `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`** on
  `(subscription_id, event_id)`, then kicks off a fire-and-forget immediate
  delivery attempt (one per row `RETURNING` actually inserted) on the running
  loop. **Never raises into the caller** and is a silent no-op when
  `FEOH_WEBHOOKS_ENABLED` is off (same best-effort contract as
  `notification_dispatch.notify_event`).

  *The dedupe must stay a DB conflict, not a caught `IntegrityError`.* Emit used
  to loop over the loaded subscriptions, commit per row, and `db.rollback()` on
  a duplicate. A rollback **expires every instance the session loaded**, so the
  next iteration's `sub.event_types` read became an implicit lazy refresh —
  synchronous IO from an async context (`MissingGreenlet`) — which
  `emit_event`'s blanket best-effort handler then swallowed. One already-queued
  duplicate therefore dropped the event for **every remaining subscription of
  that org**, silently and with no delivery row to show for it, on exactly the
  replay the dedupe exists to make safe. An org with a single subscription never
  saw it. Guard: `tests/test_outbound_webhooks.py::test_emit_duplicate_for_one_sub_still_queues_the_others`.
- **deliver** (`delivery.process_delivery`) — signs the byte-identical frozen
  payload, POSTs via `httpx` (10 s timeout), classifies the result. `2xx` →
  `delivered`; otherwise increment `attempt_count` and, if attempts remain
  (max 5), schedule `next_attempt_at` via exponential backoff
  (`30s · 2^(n-1)`); once exhausted → `dead` (dead-letter). A transport error
  (timeout / refused) is a failed attempt with a null `response_code`.
- **retry sweep** (`delivery.run_webhook_delivery_loop`) — background loop, gated
  behind `FEOH_WEBHOOKS_ENABLED` (OFF by default), re-attempts every due
  `pending`/`failed` delivery. The durable backstop for retries; the immediate
  emit attempt handles the happy path. Local-first: delivery is an in-process
  `httpx` POST — no cloud queue.

#### A due delivery is claimed before it is sent

The immediate attempt and the sweep overlap in time: `emit_event` commits the
row with `next_attempt_at = now()` and only *then* spawns the immediate attempt,
which may spend up to 10 s inside the POST. A 60-second sweep tick landing in
that window used to select the same row and POST it a second time, with the two
commits racing on `attempt_count` / `next_attempt_at` — so with N replicas a
transient receiver outage dead-lettered after roughly `5/N` rounds instead of the
documented 5 attempts.

Every load that is about to POST therefore **claims** the row
`FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` — `deliver_due` (two-phase: an unlocked due-id page,
then one claimed row at a time, because `process_delivery` commits per row and
that commit would drop a page-wide lock anyway) and `process_delivery_by_id`
alike. A row already in flight is skipped rather than double-sent, and
`attempt_count` becomes a serialized read-modify-write, so `MAX_ATTEMPTS` means
5 attempts per delivery rather than 5 per worker. `deliver_due` returns the
number of deliveries it actually claimed and attempted.

**The manual redelivery endpoint claims too**, and it is the path that was
missed. `POST /api/webhooks/deliveries/{id}/redeliver` read the row unlocked,
committed it back to `pending` with `next_attempt_at = now()`, and only then
POSTed — reproducing the emit-path window exactly, so a sweep tick landing there
sent the same delivery a second time. It now takes the row `FOR UPDATE` at the
read and holds it until `process_delivery` commits, which also serialises two
admins clicking Redeliver at once: the second waits for the first to finish and
re-reads the row rather than both passing the status guard on the same snapshot.
It then sees the first attempt's real outcome — `delivered`/`dead` gives it the
documented `409`, while a first attempt that merely failed again leaves the row
`failed`, so the second click is a genuine second retry, not a duplicate of an
in-flight one. It uses a plain `FOR UPDATE` rather than `SKIP LOCKED` because
an interactive request should wait for the truth, not silently no-op. The
requeue is consequently not committed ahead of the send, so a failure in the
send path's own commit rolls the row back to its pre-request state and the admin
retries — the honest outcome, and strictly better than a silent double-send.

### Event sources wired

**`invoice.approved` / `payment.settled`** are hooked into
`workflow_engine.transition_invoice` — the single invoice-status chokepoint —
alongside the existing notification hook, keyed off the resulting status:
`approved` → `invoice.approved`, `paid` → `payment.settled`. Every path that
converges on those statuses (the ERP-sync / payment-webhook / direct-schedule
paths) emits exactly once, here — once per *transition*, each carrying the
occurrence id that transition minted.

**`exception.raised`** is emitted from the shared exception-create chokepoint
`services/exception_service.create_exception`. Every `Exception` row in the
codebase is now constructed through this one helper — it builds the row,
flushes for the id, then best-effort emits `exception.raised` (the exception id
is the `event_key`, so a re-run / double-fire dedupes on
`(subscription, exception.raised:<exception-id>)`). The five former
construction sites all route through it, so coverage is complete (no
silent partial coverage):

| Source | Exception types | Invoice in payload? |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------|
| `invoice_warnings._ensure_exception` | `duplicate`, `po_mismatch`, `fraud_flag`, `unverified_vendor`, `amount_exceeded`, `missing_data`, `quality_hold`, `contract_noncompliant`, price-variance, LLM-anomaly | yes |
| `extraction.run_extraction` | `duplicate` (semantic), `extraction_failed` | yes |
| `review.reject_invoice` | `review_rejected` | yes |
| `positive_pay` return-processing | `fraud_flag` (altered / never-issued cheque) | only when the cheque maps to an invoice; never-issued → identifiers only |

Each caller keeps its own dedupe-precheck (different uniqueness rules), so the
helper never double-creates; it owns only the construct → flush → emit tail.
Like the invoice-status emit, it never raises into the caller and is a silent
no-op when `FEOH_WEBHOOKS_ENABLED` is off — a webhook failure can't break
exception creation or the invoice mutation that triggered it.

### Target-URL SSRF guard

A subscription's `target_url` is attacker-controllable input (any tenant admin
sets it), and the dispatcher POSTs **signed invoice/payment payloads** to it —
so the destination is validated, not just the scheme (issue #171). The single
shared validator is `services/webhooks/url_guard.ensure_public_webhook_target`,
enforced at **both** boundaries:

- **Create / update** (`POST /api/webhooks`, `PATCH /api/webhooks/{id}`) — a
  non-public target is rejected with a clean `422` carrying ONE generic message
  (`target_url must be a publicly routable http(s) URL`) for every rejection
  reason, so the response can't be used to probe which internal ranges/hosts
  exist.
- **Immediately before every dispatch** (`delivery.process_delivery`) — the
  stored host is **re-resolved at send time**, closing the TOCTOU / DNS-rebinding
  hole where a hostname passes validation at create and later flips to a private
  address. A refused send is a normal failed attempt (PII-free log — delivery id
  + event type, never the URL/host/address; no `response_code`), so the standard
  retry/backoff → dead-letter path applies.

Blocked: any target whose host resolves to an address that is not globally
routable — loopback (`127/8`, `::1`), RFC1918 private (`10/8`, `172.16/12`,
`192.168/16`), link-local `169.254/16` (incl. the AWS/cloud metadata endpoint
`169.254.169.254`) and IPv6 `fe80::/10`, CGNAT `100.64/10`, unique-local
`fc00::/7`, unspecified (`0.0.0.0`, `::`), multicast, and reserved ranges
(stdlib `ipaddress` `is_global`). **Every** address returned by `getaddrinfo`
(A and AAAA) must pass — one private record poisons the set. A literal-IP host
is judged the same way, and IPv4-mapped IPv6 (`::ffff:10.0.0.1`) is unwrapped
and judged as its embedded IPv4 address. A host that fails to resolve is
rejected (fail-closed) at create time and refused at send time.

**Escape hatch (local-first dev only):** `FEOH_WEBHOOKS_ALLOW_PRIVATE_TARGETS`
(default `false` = blocking) skips only the address checks — scheme/host shape
is still enforced — so the delivery path can be exercised against `127.0.0.1`
(e.g. a local sink) under `pnpm dev`. The committed `backend/.env.development`
sets it `true`; deployed envs must leave it at the safe default — and this is
enforced, not just documented: `app/main.py::lifespan` **refuses to boot** with
the flag on when `FEOH_DEBUG=false` (same fail-fast block as the secret-key /
billing-webhook guards).

**Residual risk:** the actual connection is opened by `httpx`, which performs
its own DNS lookup — a narrow rebinding window remains between the send-time
check and the socket connect. Pinning the checked IP for the connection itself
would close it; re-resolving immediately before send is the accepted fix per
issue #171, and the window is bounded to a single race per attempt.

### Management API (`/api/webhooks`)

Admin-gated (JWT + `require_roles(ROLE_ADMIN)`), control-plane. Every mutation
writes a PII-free audit row (`webhook_subscription.created/updated/deleted`,
`webhook_delivery.redelivered`).

| Method | Path | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| `POST` | `/api/webhooks` | Create a subscription. Validates http(s) URL + known event types + the [SSRF target guard](#target-url-ssrf-guard). Returns the `signing_secret` **once**. |
| `GET` | `/api/webhooks` | List this org's subscriptions (metadata only — never the full secret). |
| `PATCH` | `/api/webhooks/{id}` | Update name / target_url / event_types / active. A new `target_url` passes the same [SSRF target guard](#target-url-ssrf-guard). |
| `POST` | `/api/webhooks/{id}/rotate-secret` | Mint a replacement signing secret, keeping the subscription id + delivery history. Returns the new secret **once**. Optional `{overlap_minutes}` (default 60, max 1440; `0` = hard cutover) keeps the retiring secret signing `X-Webhook-Signature-Previous` — see [Rotating a signing secret](#rotating-a-signing-secret). |
| `DELETE` | `/api/webhooks/{id}` | Delete (CASCADE removes its deliveries). 404 (opaque) for wrong-org. |
| `GET` | `/api/webhooks/deliveries` | List deliveries (org-scoped), filter `subscription_id` / `status`, paginated. |
| `POST` | `/api/webhooks/deliveries/{id}/redeliver` | Re-enqueue a `failed`/`dead` delivery (resets the counter) and attempt inline. `409` on an already-`delivered` row (would double-fire). |

### Config

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `FEOH_WEBHOOKS_ENABLED` | `false` | Master switch for outbound webhooks — gates BOTH `emit_event` (OFF → silent no-op, no outbound HTTP) and the background retry/delivery sweep. OFF by default so a fresh clone / `pnpm dev` never makes outbound calls. Flip on in deployed envs. No secret — each subscription's signing secret is generated at create time and stored on the row. |
| `FEOH_WEBHOOKS_DELIVERY_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | `60` | Retry-sweep tick interval. |
| `FEOH_WEBHOOKS_ALLOW_PRIVATE_TARGETS` | `false` | SSRF-guard escape hatch — `true` lets a target URL resolve to a private/loopback address (local-first dev of the delivery path against `127.0.0.1` only; the committed `.env.development` sets it). The safe default blocks non-public targets at create/update AND again before every dispatch. Never enable in a deployed env. See [Target-URL SSRF guard](#target-url-ssrf-guard). |

## Deferred

These are explicitly **out of scope** for the current slices and tracked as
later roadmap work:

- **Full developer portal** — the published [OpenAPI spec + Swagger UI docs
  page](#published-openapi-spec) ship now; a richer hosted portal (guides,
  changelog, API-key self-service from the docs) is later work.
- **Write scopes + endpoints** — only `read` is minted today. The scope plumbing
  (`scopes` column + `require_api_scope`) is in place for it.
- **Frontend key-management UI** — the API-key mint / list / revoke / **usage**
  surface is fully built on the backend (`/api/api-keys/*`, admin-gated), but the
  SvelteKit admin screen to drive it (show the per-key usage chart from
  `GET /api/api-keys/{id}/usage`) is owned by the frontend track and not built
  here. Tracked as frontend roadmap work; the read API it will call is stable.
