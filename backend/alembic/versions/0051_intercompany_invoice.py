"""Inter-company invoice routing: counterparty_entity_id + intercompany_mirror_id.

Adds two nullable columns to ``invoices`` for inter-company charges between two
legal entities / subsidiaries of the same tenant (multi-entity):

- ``counterparty_entity_id`` — FK to ``entities.id``; the OTHER entity an
  inter-company charge is billed to.
- ``intercompany_mirror_id`` — self-referential FK to ``invoices.id``; links an
  origin invoice to its generated mirror payable (and vice-versa).

See backend/docs/inter-company.md and ``services/intercompany.py``.

Revision ID: 0051
Revises: 0050_workflow_per_entity_default
Create Date: 2026-06-19

Tenant DB only (gated on the ``invoices`` table, so it no-ops on the control
plane and fans out to every tenant via ``scripts/migrate_all_tenants.py``).

Idempotent: ``ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`` for both columns, ``pg_constraint``
guard on the FKs (Postgres has no ``ADD CONSTRAINT IF NOT EXISTS``), mirroring
``0029_entities``. The downgrade drops the constraints + columns ``IF EXISTS``.
Mirrors the ``Invoice`` model so fresh tenants built via ``create_all`` match a
migrated tenant.
