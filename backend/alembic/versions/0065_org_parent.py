"""Reseller / partner hierarchy: organizations.parent_org_id self-FK (control plane).

Adds a nullable ``parent_org_id`` self-referential FK to the control-plane
``organizations`` table so a branded CHILD tenant can point at its parent
(partner / reseller) org. NULL = a standalone tenant. A "partner" is simply any
org referenced by >= 1 child — there is no separate flag. The ``/api/partner``
surface scopes every child query to ``parent_org_id = <caller org id>``, so a
partner only ever sees / affects its own children (see
``app/api/partner.py`` + ``docs/white-label.md`` § Partner / reseller admin).

``organizations`` is a CONTROL-PLANE table (it does NOT live in
``tenant_provisioning.CONTROL_TABLES`` — that frozenset lists the *other*
control-plane tables that share the control DB; ``organizations`` itself is the
marker table the control DB is identified by). Orgs never exist in a tenant DB,
so this migration is control-plane-ONLY and must NOT fan out — gated on the
``organizations`` table existing, exactly like migration 0062 / 0055 / 0058. It
no-ops on a tenant DB.

Revision ID: 0065_org_parent
Revises: 0064_workflow_experiments
Create Date: 2026-06-20

Idempotent: ``ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`` + ``CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`` and a
guarded ``ADD CONSTRAINT``. Mirrors ``app.models.organization.Organization``
exactly so a control DB built via ``create_all`` (CI / tests) matches a
migrated one.
