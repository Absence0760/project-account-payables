"""Retry attempt chain on payments (tenant).

Adds a nullable self-referencing ``retry_of_payment_id`` to ``payments``.
``POST /api/payments/runs/{id}/retry-failed`` books a NEW payment row for
attempt #2 instead of re-arming the failed row in place, and stamps this
column with the id of the attempt it replaces.

Why the new row rather than a re-arm: ``Payment.correlation_id`` is the
PROCESSOR's idempotency key (sent as ``Idempotency-Key`` by column / dwolla /
stripe_treasury / increase, as ``idempotency_key=`` by modern_treasury, and as
a 48h Redis ``SET NX`` slot by checkeeper), and the re-arm minted a fresh one
while clearing ``failure_reason`` / ``provider_payment_id`` / ``submitted_at``
/ ``completed_at``. That erased the only handles anyone had for reconciling
what attempt #1 really did at the processor, and — for a payment the reconciler
had failed purely on age, or one lost to a read timeout after the processor
accepted — turned a retry into a second real payment. Attempt #1 is now never
written to at all; this column is the link between the two rows and is what
lets a run's rollup count the LATEST attempt per invoice instead of every row
ever (``services/payment_runs.active_run_payments``).

Revision ID: 0080_payment_retry_attempt_chain
Revises: 0079_payment_run_plan_id
Create Date: 2026-08-14

TENANT DB ONLY: ``payments`` is tenant-scoped. The upgrade is gated on the
table existing, so the revision no-ops on the control DB and fans out to every
tenant DB via ``scripts/migrate_all_tenants.py``. Fresh tenants get the column
+ index from ``create_all`` in ``tenant_provisioning`` (declared on the model).

Idempotent: ``ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`` / ``CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`` /
their ``DROP`` counterparts. The FK is added separately, guarded on
``pg_constraint``, because Postgres has no ``ADD CONSTRAINT IF NOT EXISTS``.
