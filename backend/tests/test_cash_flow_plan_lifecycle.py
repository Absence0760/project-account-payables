"""AI Cash-Flow Copilot — the saved-plan lifecycle, end to end and in depth.

Companion to `tests/test_cash_flow_saved_plans.py` (which pins the surface:
routes, RBAC, freeze/thaw, the happy-path variance) and
`tests/test_cash_flow_copilot.py` (which pins the tools and the Phase 3 enact
boundary). This file goes after the four load-bearing calls in
[decisions](../../docs/decisions.md) §54/§55 that are easy to break in a way
every existing test still reads green for:

1. **A saved plan is a frozen baseline.** The headline test does not merely
   assert `created is False` on a repeat save — it moves the world underneath
   the plan (a new in-horizon invoice, a new discount offer, a different
   opening balance), *proves a fresh proposal for the same `plan_id` would now
   say something different*, and only then asserts the second save returns the
   FIRST snapshot unchanged — response payload, stored JSONB and `updated_at`
   alike. Without the non-vacuity step, an upsert-on-save regression passes:
   restating identical data is indistinguishable from not restating it.

2. **`plan_id` is a pure hash of its resolved inputs.** Every defining input
   moves the id, `entity_id` genuinely among them (which is what makes §55's
   scope discovery safe), and an omitted value cannot collide with a present
   one — `Decimal("0")` is falsy, so a `str(x or "-")` regression would hash a
   zero threshold exactly like no threshold at all.

3. **Only fully-elapsed periods are scored, and an undated payment is counted
   rather than proxy-dated.** Both are asserted where they bite: an
   in-progress period carrying real settled cash contributes nothing to any
   total, and a `completed` payment with no `completed_at` whose `created_at`
   sits inside an ELAPSED window still leaves that period's actual at zero.

4. **Consolidated scope is discovered, never declared.** An entity-scoped plan
   enacted with that entity selected stages only that entity's commitments; a
   `consolidated: true` smuggled into the replay body cannot rescue an id that
   hashes to neither candidate.

Plus the shared money-path gates the draft-run route inherits from
`services.payment_runs.create_payment_run_for_invoices` (payable status,
financial-integrity exception, credit-memo netting, single currency) — proven
THROUGH this route, because inheriting a gate is only worth anything if the
caller actually reaches it.

Every money figure crossing the API is asserted to be an exact decimal string;
`_assert_no_float` walks each response for a `float` that would mean a JSON
number slipped in.
