"""S3/MinIO I/O never runs on the event loop, and nothing bypasses the chokepoint.

`boto3` is a synchronous client, and every file surface in this app — invoice
upload, contract/expense/tax-form/chat attachments, the Positive Pay export, the
inbound email and PEPPOL webhooks, the extraction fetch, every download proxy —
is reached from an `async def`. A bare `put_object` / `get_object` there charges
a full S3 round trip (up to `MAX_FILE_SIZE` of body) to the event loop, and for
that whole window the worker serves no other request.

`services/storage` is the single chokepoint: `_put_object` / `_get_object` /
`_delete_object` are the only places boto3 is touched, and each hands the
blocking call to `asyncio.to_thread`. These tests pin both halves — the calls
really do leave the loop thread, and no module under `app/` reaches around them.
