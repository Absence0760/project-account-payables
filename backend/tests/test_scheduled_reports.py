"""Scheduled report runner.

Tests the execution-of-one-schedule path: generate the CSV via the
exporters, email it via the configured adapter, bump next_run_at
on success / persist a failure marker on error. The cadence math
and the failure-cap behaviour live here too — they're the rules
that keep a broken provider from looping forever or a
mis-configured row from quietly never running.
