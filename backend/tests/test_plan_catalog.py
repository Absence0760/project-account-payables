"""services/billing/plan_catalog.py — default catalog + baseline Subscription.

Before this module, nothing in the app ever created a Plan or Subscription
row outside of tests (issue #180): every org's `require_entitlement` /
`require_api_entitlement` check silently failed closed, and
`services/billing/plan_change.py::change_plan` 404'd with "no live
subscription" for every org — an admin could never even upgrade. See
`test_tenant_provisioning.py::test_provision_tenant_org_can_upgrade_out_of_free`
for the end-to-end proof; this file covers `plan_catalog.py`'s own idempotency
in isolation.
