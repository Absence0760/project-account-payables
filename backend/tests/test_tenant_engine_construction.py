"""Tenant database engines are built only from a resolved org row, and stay that way.

Tenant isolation is the project's highest-blast-radius invariant, and the piece
of it asserted elsewhere is narrow: `tests/test_tenant_isolation.py` proves
`app.tenant.get_tenant` cross-checks the JWT `org` claim against the slug in
`X-Tenant-Slug`. That proves the chokepoint is *correct*. Nothing proved it is
*used*.

The gap it leaves has a real shape. A tenant session is only ever as isolated as
the URL its engine was built from, and a URL is a string: any module that does

    create_async_engine(f"{base}/feoh_{slug}")     # slug straight off the request

reaches a tenant database without the org row, without the JWT cross-check, and
without any test noticing — every guard in `get_tenant` sits upstream of a call
that never happens.

So this module pins the construction discipline rather than the string:

* `app/database.py` owns engine construction. `_make_tenant_url(db_name)` is the
  single place a tenant DB name becomes a URL, and its `db_name` comes off a
  resolved `Organization` row.
* Everywhere else under `app/`, `create_async_engine(...)` must be passed either
  `_make_tenant_url(...)` (tenant) or `settings.database_url` (control plane) —
  directly, or through a local assigned from one of them.
* The three AWS Lambda handlers are the one exception, for a stated reason, and
  are held to a narrower structural rule rather than waved through.
* A `feoh_`-prefixed database name never appears as a literal outside
  `app/config.py`, which owns the prefix.

What AST cannot prove is that a `db_name` came from a *resolved row* rather than
from the request — no static rule can. What it can prove is that every call site
goes through the one helper whose only caller-visible input is a `db_name`, which
turns reviewing a new site into a one-line question instead of an audit. Same
shape as `tests/test_pdf_render_offloaded.py` and
`tests/test_sqs_dispatch_nonblocking.py`: pure AST, no import, no database.
