"""Multi-entity Phase 2 — request-scope primitives.

Covers the building blocks in ``app.tenant``: ``get_entity_id`` header
resolution + validation, ``get_write_entity_id`` default-entity fallback,
``resolve_default_entity_id``, and the pure ``apply_entity_scope`` query
filter (including the GLAccount shared-chart carve-out).

Endpoint-level scoping (lists/aggregates honouring the header) lives in the
per-area suites; here we exercise the primitives directly so a regression in
the foundation surfaces in isolation.
