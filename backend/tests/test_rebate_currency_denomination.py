"""Every rebate rollup states the currency it is denominated in.

`card_rebates` carries **no currency column**. A rebate's denomination is only
knowable through the `virtual_cards` row it accrued on — which is why every
rebate rollup joins that table, and why five of them shipped as bare
cross-currency `SUM(CardRebate.amount)`s:

  * `GET /api/dashboard` — the "Rebates Earned" KPI on the main page
  * `GET /api/payments/summary` — `total_rebates`
  * `GET /api/cards/dashboard` — the rebate cards + YTD breakdown
  * `GET /api/cards/rebates` — the list's own `total`
  * `GET /api/analytics/cfo` — the rebate-yield NUMERATOR, divided by a
    reporting-currency denominator and then annualised

Each was a quantity in no currency at all, and several shipped under a response
that declared one two keys away. `currency_conversion.card_currency_sql` is
now the single owner of the expression.

This file guards the class, not just the instances: an AST scan over every
statement summing a rebate amount (so the NEXT rollup cannot be added bare)
plus behavioural cover for the surfaces whose figures a person reads. It does
not hardcode how many sites it expects — that count moves legitimately whenever
a rollup is split, and a stale number is a worse guard than none, so
`test_the_scan_still_finds_the_known_rollups` names the surfaces instead.
