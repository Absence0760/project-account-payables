"""Tests for the dynamic-discounting auto-capture sweep.

Two layers, mirroring ``test_approval_escalation`` + ``test_contract_renewal``:

  * Pure / mocked orchestration — the multi-tenant fan-out, per-tenant failure
    isolation, and the cost-of-capital resolver. No live DB.
  * Real-Postgres mutation — drives ``_sweep_tenant`` against a seeded tenant to
    prove the worthwhile→accept transition, the threshold gate, the
    money-path boundary (no Payment row), idempotency, the audit write, the
    date-window enforcement, and the ``expire_if_past`` wiring (issue #124).

Tier selection itself (``best_tier_for_date`` — highest-percent among tiers
still achievable, malformed-rung tolerance) is pinned in
``test_discount_offers.py``; this file only proves the sweep threads the
right reference date through it.
