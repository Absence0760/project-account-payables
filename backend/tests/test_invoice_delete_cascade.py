"""`DELETE /api/invoices/{id}` must cascade through every NO ACTION FK.

`_delete_invoice_cascade` used to clear only six tables (exceptions,
payments, payment_schedules, workflow_instances, invoice_extraction_results,
invoice_line_items). Every other table with a `NO ACTION` FK to invoices
(virtual_cards, agent_decisions, peppol_transmissions, credit_memos,
discount_offers, supplier_chat_threads, vendor_statement_recon_lines) was
missing — deleting an invoice that had one of those rows raised an unhandled
IntegrityError (500) instead of a clean delete. Grandchildren of those
tables (card_reveal_tokens/card_rebates under virtual_cards,
supplier_chat_messages under supplier_chat_threads) needed clearing first.
corporate_card_transactions is a separate case: it's an independently
imported bank-statement feed reconciled TO a virtual card, not owned by the
invoice, so it's unlinked (FK set NULL) rather than deleted.

Found live by exploratory persona-driven testing (approver persona).
Runs against the opt-in `realdb` fixture (skips without `pnpm db:up`).

# A hard delete is a tenant mutation, and it was the one leaving no record.
#
# `_delete_invoice_cascade` removes the invoice plus its exceptions, payments,
# payment schedules, workflow instances/steps, extraction results, line items,
# agent decisions, PEPPOL transmissions, credit memos, discount offers, chat
# threads and virtual cards. It deliberately does NOT touch `audit_log`, which
# is what lets a terminal `invoice.deleted` row survive the delete and keeps the
# invoice's whole prior trail readable afterwards.
#
# The audit sweep in `test_audit_append_only.py` did not catch this: it asks
# whether the string `dispatch_audit` appears anywhere in the MODULE, and
# `api/invoices.py` has 21 tenant-mutating routes, so one auditing handler
# exempted the other twenty.
