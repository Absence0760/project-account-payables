"""A NAMED provider with no registered adapter is refused — never the fixture.

`decisions.md` §29 removed the `_REGISTRY.get(x) or _REGISTRY["mock"]` fallback
from the payment / ERP / FX dispatchers, and §36 from sanctions. The reasoning
is the same everywhere and does not depend on the domain: a `mock` adapter is
**not an inert stub**. It is the thing that makes `pnpm dev` work with no cloud
account, so it answers *yes* to everything — and substituting it for a name we
do not recognise converts a configuration error into a confident wrong answer
that nothing anywhere reports.

Four registries still fell open. Two were closed in round 15 (cards, positive
pay); this file adds the other two and pins all four together, plus the drift
guard that stops a fifth appearing.

* **`card_adapters`** — `create_card` returns `success=True` with the fixture
  PAN `4242…`, so a `VirtualCard` row landed, the payment was marked
  `completed`, and the vendor was emailed a reveal link to that fixture PAN.
* **`tax_filing_adapters`** — `submit_batch` returns `accepted` with a
  `MOCK-<year>-<hex>` confirmation, so a `Tax1099Filing` row plus a
  `tax_1099.filed` audit row told the org its 1099s were e-filed when nothing
  reached the IRS — and the idempotency slot was burned, making the corrected
  retry a no-op.
* **`tin_validation_adapters`** — `validate` checks digit grouping and the IRS
  structural rules and nothing else, yet `Vendor.tin_verified_at` was stamped
  from it, driving B-notice / 24% backup-withholding decisions off a regex.
* **`positive_pay_adapters`** — renders the `csv` layout, stored under the
  REQUESTED format on the row and the audit trail with the
  `(run, bank_format)` slot burned. The bank cannot parse it, so the
  cheque-fraud control is simply not in force and nothing says so.
* **`peppol_adapters`** — `send` returns `success=True` with a synthetic
  message id and no network involved, which `peppol_send` writes onto a
  `PeppolTransmission` as `status="sent"` + a `message_id` and records as
  `invoice.peppol_sent`. A legally-significant e-invoice was reported as
  transmitted to a supplier that never received it, and the row occupied the
  live-transmission slot so the honest resend came back `already_sent`.
* **`tax_rate_adapters`** — answers every country from the in-repo
  country-rules fixture, so `/api/international-tax/{vat,gst,rate}` computed a
  jurisdiction figure off a hardcoded rate while the response's `provider`
  field named the provider that was asked for.
* **`punchout_adapters`** — `build_setup_request` returns a synthetic
  in-process start URL (persisted as a `PunchoutSession` and navigated to), and
  `parse_order_message` reads a permissive dev envelope on the PUBLIC
  cart-return route, whose fixture cart converts into a real
  `PurchaseRequisition`.
* **`qms_adapters`** — returns three deterministic fixtures that `qms_sync`
  resolves against the tenant's REAL purchase orders and persists as
  `completed` `QualityInspection` rows. Those are the 4-way match's quality
  leg, so a fabricated `pass` clears the quality gate for whatever invoice
  references that PO — a purchase order cleared for payment by an inspection
  that never happened — and a fabricated `fail` flips real invoices to
  `mismatch`. A typo'd `FEOH_QMS_PROVIDER` opts **every** org in at once.

**The caller decides what the refusal means** (§29's per-caller table). This
file pins the callers for the two registries it converts, plus the positive-pay
route (which had the refusal but no route-level coverage of it):

  | call site | on refusal |
  |---|---|
  | `POST /api/tax/1099/file` | 409 — no filing row, no confirmation, slot free |
  | `POST /api/tax/vendors/{id}/tin-verify` | 409 — `tin_verified_at` untouched |
  | `POST /api/positive-pay/ach-authorization` | 422 — no file, no row |
  | `POST /api/invoices/{id}/peppol-send` | 422 — resolved above the slot |
  |   | claim, so no `PeppolTransmission` row at all |
  | `POST /api/peppol/inbound/{slug}` | bodyless **503** — our failure, not |
  |   | a decision (§37): ask the AP to redeliver rather than ack a drop |
  | `POST /api/international-tax/{rate,vat,gst}` | 409 — pure compute, |
  |   | nothing to unwind |
  | `POST /api/catalogs/{id}/punchout/start` | 422 — no `PunchoutSession` row |
  | `POST /api/catalogs/punchout/return/{slug}` | silent 204 — the supplier |
  |   | posts once from a browser, so there is no retry to ask for |
  | `qms_sync` background sweep | counted per-tenant failure (not a skip) |
  |   | and `last_synced_at` NOT advanced |
  | `POST /api/inspections/sync` | 409 — an operator asked directly, so say |
  |   | why; nothing persisted |

The card call sites (all six of them) are pinned in
`tests/test_card_provider_resolution.py`; they are not duplicated here.

An **absent or empty** provider still resolves the local-first default in every
one of the four — guard rail 7. That is a normal state, not a misconfiguration.
