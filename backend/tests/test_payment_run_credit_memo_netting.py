"""`POST /api/payments/runs` must net applied credit memos off what's paid.

Applying a credit memo (`/api/credit-memos`) is the entire point of the
feature — it should reduce what the vendor is actually paid. Before this
fix, `create_payment_run` hardcoded `Payment.amount = inv.amount` with no
`CreditMemo` lookup anywhere in the payment path: every guard around
*applying* a memo (vendor match, currency match, no over-application) was
solid, but none of it mattered because the payment run never read it back —
the vendor was still paid the full pre-credit amount. `credit_memos.py`'s
own over-application guard (`apply` refuses a memo that would exceed the
invoice's remaining creditable balance) is what guarantees the netted
amount here can never go negative.

Runs against the opt-in `realdb` fixture (skips without `pnpm db:up`).
