"""Drift guard: every route that hands an AP actor a supplier password stamps it.

The vendor bank-change dual control refuses an approval when
``vendor_change_requests.requester_provisioned_by_user_id`` — frozen at staging
from ``VendorUser.provisioned_by_user_id`` — equals the approver. That column is
allowed to be NULL, and NULL is treated as *permissive*: a request from a portal
identity nobody in AP provisioned is approved normally.

That is only safe because of an **exhaustiveness claim**: an AP actor cannot come
to know a supplier's password without passing through a route that stamps the
column. Today the claim holds — ``POST /vendors/{id}/portal-users`` (invite) and
``POST .../portal-users/{id}/reset-password`` are the only two, and both stamp.

The claim is a property of the whole ``app/`` tree, not of any one file, so
nothing about adding a third one would fail. A new "resend credentials" or
"impersonate supplier" route that set ``hashed_password`` without stamping would
reopen the exact hole, silently, and every existing test would stay green. This
scans for that.

Companion to ``tests/test_vendor_bank_change_provisioner_sod.py``, which drives
the attack itself. See ``backend/docs/supplier-portal.md`` § Credential
provenance and the BEC dual control.
