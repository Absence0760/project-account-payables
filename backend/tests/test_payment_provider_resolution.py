"""An unsupported `settings.payments.provider` must refuse, never become `mock`.

`get_payment_adapter` used to fall back to the mock adapter for ANY provider
name it had no adapter for, on the reasoning that a misconfigured org
shouldn't 500 the payments domain. `mock` is not an inert stub, though:

  - `create_payment` returns `success=True, status=completed` immediately, so
    one typo in an admin-entered settings value (`modern-treasury` for
    `modern_treasury`) made every payment in every run report as settled while
    no money moved, and flipped the invoices to `paid`;
  - `parse_webhook` verifies no signature at all, so the same typo routed the
    public webhook route to an unverified parser — under a name the
    `provider == "mock"` early-return there can't catch;
  - `void_payment` returns True unconditionally, so an upstream void that
    never happened was recorded as `voided_upstream`.

These tests pin the fail-closed behaviour at the dispatcher AND at each caller
that has to decide what to do with the refusal. The webhook half lives in
`test_payment_webhook_security.py` beside the other public-route rejections.
