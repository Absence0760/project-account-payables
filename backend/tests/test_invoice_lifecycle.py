"""End-to-end invoice lifecycle — walks an invoice through every legal
forward transition and pins the contracts that span functions:

  - Each `transition_invoice` call writes an audit row with old/new
    status in the details payload
  - The invoice's `status` attribute mutates atomically with the audit
    write (no partial-success window)
  - The full forward path (`new → pending → ready_for_review →
    approved → sending_to_erp → sent_to_erp → posted_in_erp →
    payment_scheduled → paid → done`) is reachable without hitting a
    bad-transition 409
  - The void back-edge (`payment_scheduled → approved`, `paid →
    approved`) re-enters the queue
  - The reject loop (`ready_for_review → rejected → new` or
    `→ ready_for_review`) round-trips cleanly

`test_workflow_state_machine.py` pins the VALID_TRANSITIONS structure;
this file proves the *runtime* path through it works end-to-end.
