"""`card_settlement_block` refuses an EXPIRED card.

Converging a payment onto a pre-existing card marks that payment `completed` —
an assertion that the money moved — and advances the invoice to `paid`. The
guard therefore has to be true of the card it converges onto.

It checked two things: the card is not already spent, and its limit covers the
payable. It did NOT check `expires_at`, so a card that had simply aged out was
a valid settlement target: the payment went `completed`, the invoice went
`paid`, and the vendor was never paid at all. That is worse than the
double-spend the spent-status check exists to prevent, because there is no
charge anywhere to reconcile against — the money simply never moved.

Reachable without any race, the same way the spent case is: mint a card for a
run → the payment is voided → the invoice returns to the payable pool → a run
weeks later rediscovers the card, now past its expiry.

Recorded as an unverified lead in `docs/followups.md`
("`card_settlement_block` may ignore `expires_at`"); confirmed here.
