"""The SOX export releases its tenant connection before it transmits.

Streaming (`decisions §105`) bounded the export's memory and, in the same
stroke, extended the connection hold from "while the rows are read" to "until
the last byte reaches the client". The per-tenant pool is
`pool_size=5, max_overflow=10`, so a handful of concurrent annual exports over
slow links could exhaust it while the database itself sat completely idle —
paying a pooled resource for the client's bandwidth.

The fix keeps both properties instead of trading one for the other: the rendered
body is drained into a `SpooledTemporaryFile` (bounded RAM, then disk), the
tenant session is closed, and only then is the response returned. This file
pins the part that is easy to lose in a later refactor —

* **the connection really is back**, asserted at the moment the first body chunk
  leaves, on the engine's own pool checkout/checkin events rather than on
  anything this test taught to say so;
* **the bytes did not change**, compared against the module's independent
  materialising renderer;
* **the temp file is closed on both exits** — the last block read, and the
  client hanging up mid-download.

`test_audit_export_streaming.py` still owns the other half of the contract: that
the response is chunked and that it never truncates.
