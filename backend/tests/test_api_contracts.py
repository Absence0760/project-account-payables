"""API response contract tests.

These tests verify the shape of API responses that both the web frontend
and mobile app depend on. If a response field is renamed or restructured,
these tests break before the change reaches clients.

No database or server needed — we validate the Pydantic schemas and
hand-built dicts against the contracts that clients expect.
