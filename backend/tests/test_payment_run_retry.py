"""A payment run must explain its failures, and let you re-attempt them.

Two defects, one story:

1. **Nothing said WHY.** `Payment.failure_reason` has been populated on every
   failure path since the model was written (compliance refusal, card-issuance
   failure, adapter error, void, webhook failure) but never reached the read
   surface, and the partial-failure counts existed only in the transient
   response body of the `/execute` call that produced them. Reload the run and
   a `partial` was a bare word — the operator's only recourse was the server
   log. `PaymentRunStatus` didn't even name `partial` / `executing` /
   `cancelled`, three of the eight statuses the code actually writes.

2. **There was no way forward.** A failed payment left its invoice occupied by
   a terminal row and the run settled on `partial` for good; re-paying meant
   hand-building a second run. Most of these failures are transient by
   nature — a processor timeout, a rail outage, a compliance hold a human has
   since cleared.

`POST /api/payments/runs/{id}/retry-failed` re-arms ONLY the failed payments
and re-drives them through the same dispatcher `/execute` uses. What it must
never do — and what these tests pin — is re-dispatch a payment that already
succeeded, re-attempt an invoice that is no longer payable, or double-claim an
invoice that has since acquired another live payment.

Runs against the opt-in `realdb` fixture (skips without `pnpm db:up`).
