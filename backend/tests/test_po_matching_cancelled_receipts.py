"""The 3-way leg must not count a CANCELLED goods receipt as delivered goods.

`po_matching.match_invoice_to_po` summed `quantity_received` across every
`GoodsReceipt` for the PO with no reference to `GoodsReceipt.status`, so a
delivery the business had explicitly cancelled or reversed still filled the
receipt leg. Two consequences, both silent:

  * the invoice read `matched` (a full 3-way match) when nothing had actually
    been received — the exact thing the 3-way control exists to prevent;
  * a short receipt whose shortfall was covered by a cancelled GR never
    downgraded to `partial`, so no `po_mismatch` info exception was raised.

The mirror-image gap was the long side: over-receipt. Only `received <
ordered` was ever flagged, so MORE units booked in than were ordered passed in
silence — and an over-delivery is how an invoice for quantities nobody
authorised acquires its supporting receipt. It now sets the additive
`over_receipt` flag and appends an issue (the invoice modal renders `issues`
verbatim); `status` is deliberately left to the amount control, which is the
gate that decides whether the invoice is payable.

Runs against the opt-in `realdb` fixture, so the exclusion is proven in the
matcher's real SQL rather than against a mocked result set.
