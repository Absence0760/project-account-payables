"""The retention sweep's manifest-write gate.

`sweep_tenant` writes a `retention.archived` manifest row only when the tick has
something ACTIONABLE to record. The gate used to be `archived or overdue_total`,
and `overdue_total` counts every `audit_log` row past the window — rows this
sweep can never delete (migration 0022's BEFORE-DELETE trigger, and the WORM
invariant). So once a tenant's oldest audit row crossed its window the condition
was permanently true: a manifest reading `invoices_archived: 0` was appended on
EVERY tick, forever, and each of those manifests is itself an `audit_log` row
that ages past the window and inflates the next tick's count. Unbounded growth
in an append-only, undeletable table.

These tests pin the fix and both halves of what it must not break: the
actionable signal (`overdue_unshipped`) still writes the manifest, and so does
real archival work.
