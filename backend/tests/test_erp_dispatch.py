"""Tests for erp_dispatch routing — the inverse of test_extraction_dispatch's
lambda-routing test, which erp_dispatch lacked despite identical structure.

DB-free. Covers:
  * dispatch_erp routes to SQS in lambda mode and runs nothing locally
  * dispatch_erp schedules the local send on the CALLER's event loop (never a
    detached thread with its own loop) and never touches SQS
  * the fire-and-forget task is strongly referenced, so it can't be collected
    mid-await
  * _send_to_sqs message body + FIFO MessageGroupId shape (a silent Lambda
    payload regression double-posts to the ERP, so the contract is pinned)

The aws_endpoint_url → s3_endpoint_url fallback for this module's _send_to_sqs
is pinned alongside the extraction variant in test_aws_endpoint_override.py.
