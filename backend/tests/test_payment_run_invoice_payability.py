"""A payment run must re-check the invoice is still PAYABLE before dispatching.

The run is built against `PAYABLE_INVOICE_STATUSES`, but nothing freezes the
invoice between booking and `/execute`: `POST /api/invoices/{id}/send-to-erp`
happily walks an invoice that already holds a `pending` run payment
`approved → sending_to_erp → sent_to_erp`, and the state machine only lets
`sent_to_erp` advance to `posted_in_erp` / `done`.

The dispatch leg used to notice that only at the `transition_invoice` call —
which sits *after* `adapter.create_payment` returned and `provider_payment_id`
was assigned. `validate_transition`'s 409 then unwound into
`_dispatch_run_payments`' generic `except`, recording
`failed / unexpected_error:HTTPException` on a payment the processor had already
accepted. Nothing ever corrected it: `classify_payment_failure` reads the
populated `provider_payment_id` as IN_DOUBT (so `/retry-failed` refuses), the
webhook won't advance an already-terminal payment, and the reconciler only polls
`submitted`/`processing`. The money moved and no surface said so.

Now the payability re-check happens BEFORE the adapter call — the same place the
credit-memo `net_amount_changed` guard sits, retry-safe by construction because
no order exists yet.

The realdb cases run against the opt-in `realdb` fixture (skip without
`pnpm db:up`); the rest are pure.
