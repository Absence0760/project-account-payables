"""Two credential mints in the admin surface, held to the platform's own rules.

* **Admin-created users get a policy-compliant temp password.** `POST
  /api/admin/users` used a LOCAL 12-character generator over
  `ascii_letters + digits` with no guarantee of case mix or a digit — so the
  credential the platform itself issues could be one
  `validate_password_complexity` would refuse. Signup and partner provisioning
  already used the shared `utils.passwords.generate_temp_password`, which is
  constructed to satisfy the policy deterministically; admin now does too.

* **Minting a SCIM bearer token is audited.** That token is a tenant-wide
  user-provisioning credential — whoever holds it can create, rename and
  deactivate accounts in the org, and grant roles through group mapping. Every
  other credential mint on the platform writes an append-only row
  (`api_key.created`, `webhook_subscription.created`); this one wrote nothing,
  so a rotation left no trace for an access review. The row is PII-free and
  carries only the non-secret digest prefix.
