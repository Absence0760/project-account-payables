"""Cross-family drift guard: a registered adapter may not lie about its contract.

Every ``app/services/*_adapters/`` family (plus ``audit_shipping``) is a registry
of selectable providers behind one interface. Two failure modes recur across
them, and neither breaks a test on its own — which is exactly why they need a
guard:

1. **A method that can never do its job.** A skeleton adapter is registered and
   selectable, but a core method raises ``NotImplementedError`` no matter how it
   is configured. Nothing fails until the first real caller, who gets a 500 from
   a path whose interface promised a value.
2. **A probe that outruns the contract.** That same skeleton answers
   ``test_connection() is True`` on credentials alone, so the surface an
   operator uses to catch a misconfiguration confirms a healthy integration that
   cannot satisfy its own core method. ``tests/test_tax_rate_adapters.py``
   established the rule for one family (``avalara`` / ``taxjar``); this file
   generalises it to all of them.

The mechanism is the one ``tests/test_payment_adapter_capabilities.py`` uses for
optional capabilities: **an explicit inventory with the consequence written
down**. Any registered adapter method that can never return is discovered by an
AST scan and must appear in :data:`SKELETON_METHODS` — and every adapter listed
there must report an unavailable probe. Adding a new skeleton, or quietly
neutering a working adapter into one, fails the suite until someone records what
the caller then sees.

What this file deliberately does NOT claim to catch: a probe that reports healthy
without ever contacting the provider while its core methods *are* implemented
(the `tax1099` TIN-match probe that returned True for any non-empty key — it
routed through `validate`, whose offline format check short-circuits before any
HTTP). Nothing static distinguishes that from a real call; it is pinned
per-adapter, in ``tests/test_tin_validation.py``.

Pure Python: no DB, no network. Importing each family's modules self-registers
its adapters, exactly as production does.
