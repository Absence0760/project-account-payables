"""POST /api/invoices/bulk/status must not bypass the approval controls.

Routing a bulk transition straight to `approved` skipped segregation-of-duties,
the max-amount cap, and the CFO gate — so an AP manager could bulk-approve their
own uploads. The fix routes `approved` targets through review.approve_invoice
(the same path the single-invoice endpoint uses), skipping any invoice that
fails a control instead of aborting the batch.

The same hole existed on the other branch and on the payment path:

- `rejected` was applied with a bare `transition_invoice`, so it wrote no
  `review_rejected` exception, never bumped `rejection_count`, and never cleared
  `WorkflowInstance.state_data["approval_levels"]` — a reworked invoice then
  resumed its approval chain at the level it was rejected at, counting a
  pre-correction approval as still valid. It now routes through
  `review.reject_invoice`, the single reject chokepoint that clears the chain.
- `payment_scheduled` (a legal edge off `approved`) let a bulk call mark invoices
  scheduled with no PaymentRun / Payment behind them, past the payment-blocking
  exception gate, the CFO threshold, run segregation and the sanctions screen —
  and freeze them into IMMUTABLE_STATUSES with no payment to void. It and the
  other system-driven states are now refused with a 422.
- The remaining bare-`transition_invoice` branch (`new` / `pending` / `done`, and
  `ready_for_review` for an invoice that isn't `rejected`) let a state-machine
  409 escape UNCAUGHT, which aborted the whole request — so a mixed selection
  rolled back every transition the batch had already made instead of reporting
  the one member as `skipped`.
