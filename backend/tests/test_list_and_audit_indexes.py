"""The ``audit_log`` sweeps and every list endpoint's default sort order are
indexed — migration 0092.

Two query shapes had no index at all before 0092, and both ran against tables
that only grow:

1. ``audit_log``, the largest table in a tenant, had nothing on ``created_at``
   or ``action`` — so the SOX signature sweep, the auditor's date-range export,
   the dashboard's approval-timing leg, the adaptive feedback reads and the
   retention sweep were each a full sequential scan.

   The shipper's own ``WHERE shipped_at IS NULL ORDER BY created_at ASC LIMIT
   n`` — **per tenant, every 60 s, returning nothing on a healthy platform** —
   was a full scan only on tenants provisioned by ``create_all``. Migration
   ``0010_audit_log_shipping`` built ``ix_audit_log_shipped_at_null`` for it, but
   nothing declared it on the model, and fresh tenants never run Alembic. That
   split is exactly what this file now makes impossible.
2. Seven list endpoints ordered by a column with no index, so page 1 of every
   list view was a whole-table read plus a top-N heapsort.

Measured before landing 0092 (local Postgres 16, warm cache, third run of each
query; the full table is in the migration's docstring):

    1.2 M audit rows   shipper, caught up *      39.740 ms → 0.040 ms
                       verify-signatures 30 d    41.010 ms → 4.198 ms
                       audit export 7 d          64.427 ms → 1.381 ms
    200 k invoices     list page 1               15.780 ms → 0.031 ms
                       list page 1 + status      13.068 ms → 0.053 ms

    * what a `create_all`-provisioned tenant was paying; a migrated one already
      had migration 0010's index.

What this file pins:

1. **Every index the migration creates is also declared on its model.** Tenants
   are provisioned two ways — ``tenant_provisioning._create_tenant_tables``
   (``create_all``, fresh tenants) and Alembic (existing tenants) — so an index
   that lives only in the migration leaves the two schemas permanently
   different. This is what fails if a later migration drops one.
2. **The two spellings produce the SAME index**, column-for-column and
   predicate-for-predicate, checked against what Postgres actually built.
3. **The revision is tenant-gated**, so it no-ops on the control plane (which
   has none of these eight tables) while still advancing its head.
4. **The DDL applies, is idempotent, and reverses.**
5. **Each index is usable for the predicate it was added for**, asserted under
   ``enable_seqscan = off`` — that tests the SHAPE of the index against the
   shape of the query, which is deterministic, rather than "would the planner
   pick it", which at the harness's handful of rows would be a fiction (the
   real-volume choice is the measurement above).

`ix_audit_log_shipped_at_null` turned out to be one instance of a class of 20.
The rest are closed by migration 0093, and
`tests/test_migration_model_index_parity.py` is the systemic guard that now
covers EVERY `CREATE INDEX` in EVERY revision — opt-out, so a new migration-only
index fails on the day it lands. This file stays the per-index guard for 0092's
own sixteen (including that each actually serves its caller's query, which the
systemic one does not assert).
