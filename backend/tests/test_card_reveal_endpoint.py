"""HTTP-boundary tests for the single-use card-reveal endpoint.

``test_card_reveal.py`` covers the service layer (mint/consume branches)
against a mocked session. This file covers the ``GET /portal/cards/{token}``
*handler* — the glue the service tests never reach:

  * consume-reason -> HTTP-status mapping (invalid 404, expired 410, used 410)
  * the append-only audit row written when the single-use token is consumed
    (``card.revealed_via_token``, actor_id=None) — a regression that drops
    the dispatch would otherwise be invisible
  * **the claim is committed BEFORE the outbound provider call** — the
    ordering that keeps a slow / failing / crashing provider round-trip from
    leaving a link that has already been revealed re-usable
  * PII suppression on the two degraded paths (org disabled cards after
    issuance; adapter outage) — pan/cvv must come back None and no PAN leaks;
    the token stays spent on both (fail-closed by design: a link that survives
    a failed reveal is indistinguishable from a twice-revealable link)
  * the resolved tenant's org id is threaded into consume_reveal_token as the
    defense-in-depth binding (token + card must both belong to the tenant)

The handler imports its collaborators inside the function from their source
modules, so we patch them at the source. The tenant ``db`` is mocked and the
tenant ``Organization`` is passed in directly (reveal_card no longer opens a
control-plane session) — matching the suite's unit-test convention.

Out of scope here (covered elsewhere, by design):
  * single-use durability across a real commit+re-read — the ``used_at``
    flip is asserted in ``test_card_reveal.py`` against the service.
  * cross-tenant token reveal — the token lookup runs on the tenant ``db``
    resolved by ``get_tenant_db``, whose isolation chokepoint is tested in
    ``test_tenant_isolation.py``.
