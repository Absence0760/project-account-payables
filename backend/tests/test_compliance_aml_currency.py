"""The AML trailing-spend signal is denominated in the org's HOME currency.

`settings.compliance.aml_spend_alert_threshold` is a bare number in the home
currency (`compliance._home_currency` — the same field the KYC threshold and
the FX-leg decision read). The trailing sum was
`COALESCE(Payment.source_amount, Payment.amount)`:

* `source_amount` is the home-currency leg, but it is NULL on every payment
  that never took the FX path — the entire `virtual_card` leg returns before
  it, and so does any domestic rail;
* `Payment.amount` is denominated in the **invoice's** currency.

So a ¥500,000 card payment (~$3.4k) was added straight onto a USD threshold as
`500000`, and the mirror case — a JPY-home org paying a USD vendor —
under-counts by the same factor and never fires. Same shape as
`docs/decisions.md` §35, in a compliance signal rather than a rollup.

What the home currency can't express is now EXCLUDED and counted, and the alert
states the exclusion so its figure reads as the floor it is. Deliberately not a
`reasons` entry on the under-threshold path: that would hold every payment to
the vendor forever, and `/compliance/release` re-runs this same gate, so it
could never clear — a dead end, not a control.

Runs against the opt-in `realdb` fixture (skips without `pnpm db:up`).
