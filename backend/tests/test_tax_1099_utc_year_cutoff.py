"""The 1099 calendar-year cutoff must be pinned to UTC, not the Postgres
session's `timezone` GUC.

`build_1099_report` joins completed payments to their vendor with
`extract("year", Payment.completed_at) == year`. `Payment.completed_at` is
`TIMESTAMPTZ`, and Postgres's `EXTRACT(YEAR FROM …)` on a `timestamptz`
implicitly converts the value into the SESSION's `timezone` setting before
pulling the year out of it — unlike a plain `timestamp`, which carries no
zone conversion at all. A payment completed right after midnight UTC on
January 1st is still December 31st in every zone west of UTC, so on a
non-UTC server session it silently slid into the wrong tax year: excluded
from the (correct) new year's report and counted in the (wrong) prior year's.

This is the same class of bug `bank_reconciliation.py`'s `sent_on_expr`
already guards against for its own `completed_at`-derived date filter — this
file pins the fix for the 1099 aggregation path.
