"""Critical-path tests for the money-moving payment flow.

This file fills the genuine gaps left by the existing payment suite,
focused on the highest-risk client flow — the payment run lifecycle and
the CFO sign-off gate. The sibling files already cover:

  - `test_payment_run_flow.py`  — execute run rollups, field hydration,
    the already-completed (409) and CFO-unapproved (403) execute guards.
  - `test_payment_run_actions.py` — void / cancel / approve *guard*
    rejections (404 / 409).
  - `test_payment_webhook_security.py` — webhook HMAC + dedup + terminal
    no-downgrade.

What's NOT covered there, and lives here:

  1. `create_payment_run` — entirely untested. The CFO-threshold
     computation (sets `requires_cfo_approval` by total vs the org's
     `payments.cfo_approval_above`), the malformed-threshold fail-CLOSED
     (a corrupted threshold must require CFO sign-off, never silently
     disable the gate), 404 on a missing invoice, and the Decimal total
     summation are all money-path invariants with no coverage.
  2. `approve_payment_run` happy path — only the guard rejections are
     tested; the actual CFO sign-off (stamps `cfo_approved_at`, writes
     the `payment_run.cfo_approved` audit row) is not.
  3. The end-to-end CFO gate: a run created above the threshold is
     blocked at /execute (403), and only after /approve does /execute
     proceed — i.e. the gate is enforced *before* the adapter is called,
     so no money moves on an un-approved over-threshold run.
  4. Execute writes an audit row on the invoice status change (via
     `transition_invoice`, never a bare `invoice.status = ...` assign) —
     the append-only-audit invariant for the settle path.

All tests are unit-level against the real handler coroutines with mocked
AsyncSessions, matching the established pattern in the sibling files.
