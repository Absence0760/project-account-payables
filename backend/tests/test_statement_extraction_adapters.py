"""Unit coverage for the ``extract_statement`` extraction-adapter capability.

Covers the optional-capability default (an adapter that hasn't implemented it
reports "not supported" instead of pretending), the shared model-payload
parser, the deterministic offline reader the ``mock`` adapter uses in place of a
model, and both model-backed adapters' happy + failure paths with the network
stubbed.
