"""Drift guard: every request-side ``Decimal`` is bounded to its column.

**The bug this exists to stop.** A Pydantic field typed as a bare ``Decimal``
accepts any magnitude. The column it lands in does not: ``Numeric(15, 2)``
holds 13 integer digits, and Postgres answers anything larger with
``NumericValueOutOfRangeError``. Nothing catches that, so it surfaced as an
unhandled ``DataError`` — **a 500 for input the caller got wrong**, which is a
422. It was reported against ``app/schemas/expense.py`` (``docs/followups.md``),
but the same shape was live on ``POST /api/invoices`` (the money path) and on
``POST /api/international-tax/vat``, where an absurd ``net_amount`` instead
reached ``Decimal.quantize`` and raised ``InvalidOperation``. Two different
explosions, one root cause: an unbounded ``Decimal`` at the API boundary.

**Why a guard and not just the fix.** This defect propagates by copy-paste — a
new schema field is written by copying the line above it, and the line above it
was unbounded. Fixing the 62 live fields without a guard just resets the clock.

**The population is derived, not listed.** Following
``tests/test_exception_type_labels.py``: a hand-maintained list of "the fields
that matter" is itself the thing that goes stale. Instead this walks the live
FastAPI app, collects every model reachable as a **request body** (transitively,
through nested models), and requires an answer for each ``Decimal`` field it
finds. Response-only schemas are deliberately out of scope — they are never
validated on input, and several legitimately carry a cross-invoice aggregate
that exceeds any single column's precision, so bounding them would reject
correct data.

An answer is one of:

* carry BOTH ``max_digits`` and ``decimal_places``, and — when the field maps to
  a real column via :data:`COLUMN_FOR` — have them **equal** that column's
  ``precision`` / ``scale``. Equality both ways is the point: a *looser* bound
  leaves the 500, and a *tighter* one rejects data the database would have
  accepted, which is the worse failure of the two.
* appear in :data:`UNBOUNDED_BY_DESIGN` with the reason written down.

**Known, accepted behaviour change.** ``decimal_places`` *rejects* a value with
more fractional digits than the column's scale, where Postgres silently
**rounds** it. That is deliberate: "money is exact" is a project invariant, and
quietly rounding a submitted amount is a data-integrity defect of its own. It is
also not optional — ``max_digits`` alone counts *total* digits, so bounding only
that would reject ``0.1234567890123456`` (16 digits, all fractional), which the
column accepts. The two constraints are only correct together.

Pure Python: no DB, no network. Importing ``app.main`` builds the real router
tree, exactly as ``tests/test_rbac.py`` does.
