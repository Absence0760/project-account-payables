"""RBAC tests — `require_roles` semantics + the coverage gate that no API
endpoint regresses to "no auth dependency" once added.

The coverage gate is the more important of the two: the dependency itself is
small and easy to reason about, but adding a router endpoint without any auth is
precisely the kind of mistake that put us in this hole to begin with.

**How the gate resolves auth, and why it changed.** It used to introspect only
the endpoint function's own signature and accept ANY dependency whose closure
happened to be named ``checker`` — the house style for all five factories in
``deps.py``. That name match is not a security property: renaming a closure
broke the gate, and an unrelated helper called ``checker`` satisfied it. The
gate now walks ``route.dependant`` (the same tree walk
``test_sod_endpoint_wiring.py`` uses) and resolves the auth dependencies **by
identity** against the actual callables exported by ``app/api/deps.py`` /
``portal_deps.py``. Every factory — ``require_roles``, ``require_permission``,
``require_api_scope``, ``require_entitlement``, ``require_api_entitlement`` —
declares ``get_current_user`` / ``get_api_key_principal`` as its own
sub-dependency, so they are all covered for free and none of them can be
satisfied by a name.

**The allowlist is now two lists with two different obligations**, because a
single ``NO_AUTH_REQUIRED`` set made zero assertions once an entry was listed:
deleting ``Depends(get_scim_tenant)`` from all six SCIM ``/Groups`` handlers — a
credential that creates accounts and grants roles — left the suite green.

``PUBLIC_BY_DESIGN``
    Routes that must answer an anonymous caller. Each is **driven** with a real
    credential-free request and asserted to return something other than
    401/403. Listing a route no longer exempts it: a route that actually
    requires a credential fails this probe.

``ALTERNATE_AUTH``
    Routes gated by something other than the JWT — a SCIM bearer, a signed
    action token, a webhook HMAC, a password, a single-use emailed token. Each
    names its specific gate, asserted present either as a dependency resolved by
    identity in ``route.dependant`` (SCIM) or as a symbol the handler's own code
    references (everything whose verification happens in the handler body,
    which is most of them). Deleting the gate fails the suite.
