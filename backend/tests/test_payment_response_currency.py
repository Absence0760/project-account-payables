"""A payment (and a payment run) states what its money is denominated in.

`payments` has no currency column and `payment_runs.total_amount` is one bare
`Numeric` — a payment settles in its INVOICE's currency, and a run inherits the
one currency `create_payment_run_for_invoices` proved its invoices share. Both
read surfaces joined the invoice row already (for `vendor_name`), and neither
carried the code, so every `/payments` reader fell back to the org default.

The worst instance was the Accept-settlement dialog, which renders "Authorized"
beside "Settled": `settled_currency` was on the wire and the authorized figure's
currency was not, so a EUR payment showed a fabricated `$1,200.00` directly
above a real `€1,150.00` — the two figures that dialog exists to compare, on the
screen built to catch a `currency_mismatch`.

The rule these pin is `docs/decisions.md` §79/§82: where the currency cannot be
PROVEN, report `None` and let the client render the bare figure. A substituted
default is the fabrication, and a run whose legs disagree has a total
denominated in nothing real, so a code there would be worse than none.

DB-backed via `realdb` (skips without the dev Postgres) — the point is what the
HTTP surface actually returns off real joined rows.
