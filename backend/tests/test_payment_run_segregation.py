"""Maker-checker segregation on the payment-run money path.

The user who CREATES a payment run must not be the one who EXECUTES it (the
money-movement step) or CFO-approves it. This is orthogonal to the role split:
the default `ap_manager` holds both `payment_run.approve` and `payment_execute`,
so without this identity check one user could run the whole payment lifecycle
solo. Default-on; per-org opt-out for single-operator accounts.

Pure-helper tests are DB-free; the wiring tests use `realdb` (the endpoint
functions are called directly, like test_payment_concurrency).
