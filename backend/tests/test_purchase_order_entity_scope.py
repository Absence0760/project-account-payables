"""`GET /api/purchase-orders/{id}` must not list another subsidiary's invoices.

`linked_invoices` was built by joining on `po_number` alone — no
`apply_entity_scope`, and the route takes no entity dependency at all. But
`po_number` is NOT unique across subsidiaries: `services/po_matching` designs
around exactly that (its own PO lookup is entity-scoped, with two subsidiaries
each numbering from `PO-1001` as the documented case). So a US-scoped viewer
opening a PO saw the UK subsidiary's invoices — number, vendor name and amount
— on the detail panel. Entity isolation is a data-layer invariant, so the join
now carries the PO's OWN entity (∪ unstamped rows).

The same unscoped `po_number` match existed one route away, on the sync-erp
upsert: a sync run under subsidiary B found subsidiary A's PO by number and
overwrote its `total` / `status`. That is the cross-entity WRITE of the same
bug, and it silently re-prices the amount control 3-way match runs A's invoices
against.

Runs against the opt-in `realdb` fixture (skips without `pnpm db:up`).
