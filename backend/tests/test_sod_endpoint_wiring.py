"""Endpoint SoD wiring — the splittable, money/approval-sensitive routes gate on
`require_permission(...)`, not bare `require_roles(...)`.

Why this matters: the granular-permission layer exists so an org can SPLIT
fraud-sensitive duties (approve invoices vs. move money) onto custom roles. A
route still on `require_roles` silently ignores that split — a custom role that
had `payment.execute` stripped could still move money, and a custom role granted
`invoice.approve` could not actually approve. These tests pin the wiring so a
future refactor can't quietly drop a route back onto `require_roles`.

We resolve each route's `require_permission` checker out of its FastAPI
dependency tree and exercise it directly with a user holding / lacking the
permission — so the test covers BOTH "this route is permission-gated" and "it
gates on the RIGHT permission set," with no DB.

**The pin is inverted, not hand-maintained.** `CASES` used to be a hand-written
list, and a hand-written list omits things: the eight routes that actually move
money (`execute`, `void`, `settlement/accept`, `compliance/release`,
`compliance/dismiss`, `resume`, `sync-erp`, `retry-failed`) were all missing from
it, on the one class of route where the SoD layer existing at all is the point,
and two of the eight catalogue permissions were never imported here.
`test_every_permission_gated_route_is_pinned` closes that for good: it derives the
set of permission-gated routes from the running app and fails if any of them is
absent from `CASES`. Adding a `require_permission` route now REQUIRES adding it
here, with the exact permission set it gates on.
