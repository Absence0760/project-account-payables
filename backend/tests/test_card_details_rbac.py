"""RBAC pin for `GET /api/cards/{card_id}/details` (full PAN + CVV reveal).

The endpoint used to declare `require_roles(admin, ap_manager, cfo)` at the
route decorator, then immediately re-check a narrower, CONTRADICTORY role set
inline in the handler body (`{"admin", "ap_manager"}`) — silently excluding
`cfo` even though the decorator says it's allowed. Not access-widening (it
failed closed), but dead/contradictory logic that would mislead the next
edit. Resolved by dropping the inline check and keeping the decorator as the
single source of truth: `cfo` is READ access to sensitive financial data
(consistent with every other endpoint in this file, and the read/write split
elsewhere in the codebase — e.g. `positive_pay._READ_ROLES` includes `cfo`,
`_WRITE_ROLES` doesn't). `ap_clerk` stays refused either way — the frontend
e2e `pan-reveal-pii.spec.ts` already pins that case; this test adds the
role-matrix coverage across all four roles at the API layer.
