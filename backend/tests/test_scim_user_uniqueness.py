"""SCIM `userName` uniqueness is platform-wide, and rejected as a SCIM 409.

`users.email` carries a global UNIQUE constraint — it is the login identifier,
and `/auth/login` resolves an account by address alone with no tenant hint. The
SCIM write paths checked uniqueness only within the calling tenant (create, PUT)
or not at all (PATCH), so an IdP pushing an address already held in a DIFFERENT
tenant sailed past the guard and tripped the constraint on `flush()`: an
unhandled `IntegrityError`, i.e. a 500, where RFC 7644 §3.3 / §3.5.2 require a
409 `uniqueness`. Providers treat a 5xx as retryable, so the same doomed write
came back on every reconcile cycle.

These run against real Postgres because the constraint IS the bug: a mocked
session can't tell a scoped predicate from a global one. Tenant B's seeded admin
supplies a real address that exists in another org.

The handlers are driven directly rather than over HTTP so the tests don't have
to stand up a per-tenant SCIM bearer token; `get_scim_tenant` (the auth
dependency) is covered by `test_rbac.py`.
