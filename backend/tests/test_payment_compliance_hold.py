"""A payment held at `pending_compliance` must be surfaced and resolvable.

`check_payment_compliance`'s own docstring promises a `hold` verdict "opens
an exception for AP review" — none of the four call sites in
`_execute_single_payment` actually did, so a held payment was invisible
everywhere except its own `failure_reason` field, and nothing could ever
move it forward: `/resume` explicitly skips `pending_compliance` rows, and
no endpoint let AP retry, release, or dismiss one. Found by exploratory
persona-driven testing (payment-processor persona). Filed as #235.

Covers, end to end over the real HTTP endpoints:
  - a hold (via the deterministic "no screenable vendor" trigger — an
    approved invoice with `vendor_id=NULL`) opens a `payment_compliance_hold`
    Exception, visible via `GET /api/exceptions`
  - `POST /payments/{id}/compliance/dismiss` flips the payment to `failed`
    and resolves the exception, without ever reaching the adapter
  - `POST /payments/{id}/compliance/release` re-runs compliance-then-adapter;
    once the invoice has a real (unblocked) vendor attached, the hold clears,
    the payment settles, and the exception resolves
  - `/release` and `/dismiss` both 409 on a payment that isn't
    `pending_compliance` (RBAC / guard coverage, not just the happy path)

Runs against the opt-in `realdb` fixture (skips without `pnpm db:up`).
