"""One recorder for a completed payment — settlement verdict AND realized FX.

There are exactly two paths on which a payment reaches ``completed``: the
processor's webhook (`api/payments.payment_webhook`) and the reconciler
backstop that exists for when that webhook never arrives
(`services/payment_reconciler`). They had already drifted once on the
settlement verdict; the fix factored that into
`services/payment_settlement_record.record_settlement` — and then they drifted
again, one field over.

**Realized FX gain/loss was computed inline in the webhook handler and nowhere
else.** So every cross-currency payment the backstop recovered booked no
realized gain or loss at all — silently, permanently, and on the exact
population with the least evidence by construction. Nothing downstream
re-derives it either: the webhook handler refuses an already-terminal payment,
so a late webhook could not supply the missing figure.

These tests pin both halves of the fix:

* the **behaviour** — a cross-currency payment settled by the backstop carries
  ``details.realized_fx_gain_loss`` on its append-only audit row, at the same
  figure the webhook path books for the same inputs;
* the **drift guard** — `record_completion` is the only place under ``app/``
  that computes realized FX for a settlement, so a third completion path
  cannot reintroduce the gap by copying a block instead of calling the owner.
