"""A list's KPI rollup must describe the same set as the table beneath it.

Six list pages shipped a KPI row computed over the rows already LOADED (PR
#349), and `GET /api/invoices/counts` ignored the list's filters entirely (PR
#352). Both produce the same lie: a headline that contradicts the table under
it as soon as the population is larger than one page or narrower than the whole
tenant.

The fix in every case was a shared `_*_list_filters` builder called by both the
list endpoint and its `/summary`. This file guards that shape three ways:

  * **Discovery** — every `GET .../summary` paired with a list parent is
    checked, so a NEW list page with a KPI is covered without editing this
    file. Exemptions must be named and justified below, not silently skipped.
  * **Contract** — the summary must accept every filter its list offers, read
    off the mounted OpenAPI schema rather than the function signature. A
    parameter declared as a plain default (`search: str | None = None`) is a
    real query parameter but is NOT a `fastapi.params.Query` instance, so a
    signature-level check misses it and passes vacuously.
  * **Wiring** — both endpoints in each module must route through the shared
    filter builder, so neither can hand-roll a divergent set of predicates.

# and the vendors chips hand-rolled a predicate set that had already diverged
# on `source` — precisely because neither endpoint's path ends in `/summary`.
#
# §48 states the contract a counts endpoint owes its list. It has three parts,
# and each is asserted below:
#
#   1. it takes every NARROWING filter the list takes, so the chips describe
#      the rows the table shows;
#   2. it deliberately does NOT take `status`, because status is the dimension

#      for every other chip, the exact "chip that lies" failure the endpoint
#      exists to prevent;
#   3. its RBAC matches the list's EXACTLY, in both directions. Tighter and a
#      caller sees rows above chips that cannot explain them (and the page
#      falls back to the page-scoped tally the endpoint replaced). Looser and a
#      role deliberately kept out of the queue can still read its size.
#
# Discovery is automatic: the handler name comes off the OpenAPI `operationId`,
