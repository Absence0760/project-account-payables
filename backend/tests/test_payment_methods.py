"""Payment-rail classification + its drift guard.

``services/payment_methods`` decides two things about every ``Payment.method``
rail:

  * which the payer reports on a 1099 and which the card settlement entity
    reports on a 1099-K — getting that wrong files a wrong number with the IRS
    in either direction; and
  * which rails are **international** — which decides whether an FX rate is
    locked onto the row, whether a caller's corridor override is trusted, and
    whether the vendor must be KYC-verified.

Both registries have to stay exhaustive, so the drift tests below fail the
moment a rail exists anywhere in the codebase without BOTH treatments.
