"""Coverage for ``app.services.payment_erp_sync`` — the post-payment-run
sync-back that marks ``payment_scheduled`` invoices ``paid`` and writes an
audit row.

``_sync_payments`` builds its own control + tenant engines from
``settings.database_url`` / ``org.db_name``, so the realdb test tenants
(which live in the same Postgres) are reachable from inside it. The tenant
data is committed before the call, and re-read with a fresh session after.
``settings.erp`` is set on the control-plane org so the sync isn't skipped.
