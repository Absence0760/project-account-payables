"""Every approval money threshold is denominated in the org's reporting currency.

`max_invoice_amount`, `require_cfo_above` and the approval chain's per-level
`min_amount` / `max_amount` bands are bare numbers on a JSONB config with no
currency of their own. They were all compared against a raw `Invoice.amount` in
whatever currency the invoice was billed in, so a GBP 9,000 invoice — USD 11,400
— read as under a USD 10,000 `require_cfo_above` and was approved with no CFO
signature. `require_cfo_above` is the control that decides whether a CFO has to
sign at all, so this is the sharpest instance of the class.

The rule now has ONE owner rather than five spellings:
`approval_chain.GateAmount` (a figure in the gate currency, or an explicit
"could not be expressed there") built by `approval_chain.reporting_gate_amount`
at the rate already LOCKED on the invoice row, and consumed by the shared
`_money_gate_applies` body plus `resolve_applicable_levels`. An amount that
cannot be expressed fails CLOSED everywhere: the gates fire, every chain level
applies, and the auto-approve floor does not.

Every test here fails against the previous implementation — `GateAmount` /
`reporting_gate_amount` did not exist, the gates took a bare `Decimal` and
compared it at face value, and the AST guard finds raw amounts at every call
site.
