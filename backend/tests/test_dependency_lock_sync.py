"""Guard the hash-pinned locks against drifting from their manifests.

Dependabot's pip ecosystem updates `backend/pyproject.toml`, but it has no
idea `requirements.lock` / `requirements-dev.lock` exist — its pip-compile
support only recognises a lockfile whose name ends in `.txt` and matches an
`.in` file's basename, which these deliberately don't (they're compiled from
pyproject.toml, not from a `.in`). So a merged Dependabot PR can raise a
floor in pyproject.toml while the locks keep installing the old version, and
the production image quietly ships pins nobody declared. That failure is
silent: `--require-hashes` still succeeds, because the stale lock is
internally consistent.

These tests make it loud. They compare *declared constraints* against
*locked versions* — no re-resolution, no network — so they only fail when
someone actually changed a manifest without regenerating its lock, never
because a new version appeared on PyPI overnight. Regenerate with the
commands in backend/CLAUDE.md → Dependency lock.
