"""Seed workflow back-fill — ``_seed_workflows_for_invoices``.

Regression guard for the "approvals surface is empty in dev" bug: the seed used
to create invoices in ``ready_for_review`` without any ``WorkflowInstance`` /
``WorkflowStep`` rows, so the approval queue and the assistant's
``list_pending_approvals`` tool (which joins to an *active approval step*) read
empty. These pure tests assert the helper now emits the right steps per status —
crucially an ACTIVE approval step assigned to the org admin for
``ready_for_review`` invoices.
