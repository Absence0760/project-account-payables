"""Standalone `POST /api/payments` enforces the `cfo_approval_above` gate.

The run-based path (`create_payment_run`) has always computed
`requires_cfo_approval` off the org's `payments.cfo_approval_above` threshold
and refused `/execute` until a CFO signs off. The standalone single-invoice
path had no equivalent check at all — any actor holding `payment.execute`
could book an above-threshold payment directly, a structural gap in the CFO
sign-off invariant (issue #129).

A standalone payment has no separate `/execute` step to gate the way a run
does (`requires_cfo_approval` lives on `PaymentRun`, not `Payment`), so the
fix gates at CREATION time instead: an above-threshold amount requires the
creating actor to hold the CFO role, or the request is refused (403) and the
caller is pointed at the payment-run flow. A misconfigured (non-numeric)
threshold fails CLOSED — every standalone payment then requires a CFO,
mirroring `create_payment_run`'s identical fail-closed handling of the same
setting.

The same file also pins the OTHER way that gate could be walked around: the
endpoint used to accept a `payment_run_id` in the body and write it straight to
the FK unvalidated. `PaymentRun.requires_cfo_approval` is computed once from
`total_amount` at run creation and never recomputed, so N legs each
individually under the threshold could be injected into an existing run and
`/execute` would dispatch the inflated total with no sign-off.

All DB-backed via `realdb` (requires the dev Postgres; skips otherwise).
