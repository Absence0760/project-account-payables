"""All four budget dimensions are indexed on ``invoices`` — migration 0090.

``Budget.dimension`` has four legal values and
``services/budget_service._DIMENSION_MATCH_COLUMN`` attributes realised invoice
spend by an equality against the matching ``Invoice`` column. Two of those four
— ``department`` / ``project`` — have been indexed since migration 0044;
``cost_center`` and ``gl_account`` predate it and carried no index at all, so
the same query shape got an index scan on half the dimensions and a full seq
scan of ``invoices`` on the other half.

Measured before landing 0090 (local Postgres 16, single-entity tenant, warm
cache, median of 7 runs of the exact ``_actual_invoice_legs`` SQL; ``department``
is the already-indexed control and does not move):

    40 000 invoices   cost_center  7.7 ms → 1.8 ms   Seq Scan → Bitmap Index Scan
                      gl_account   6.5 ms → 1.5 ms   Seq Scan → Bitmap Index Scan
                      department   2.7 ms → 2.7 ms   unchanged (control)
    200 000 invoices  cost_center 15.9 ms → 7.4 ms   Seq Scan → Bitmap Index Scan
                      gl_account  14.9 ms → 6.7 ms   Seq Scan → Bitmap Index Scan
                      department   9.6 ms → 9.6 ms   unchanged (control)

What this file pins:

1. **The four dimensions stay symmetric.** Every column
   ``_DIMENSION_MATCH_COLUMN`` can select is indexed on the model, so a fifth
   dimension cannot be added onto an unindexed column without failing here.
2. **The migration DDL applies to a real tenant DB, is idempotent, and reverses.**
3. **The migration's index NAMES equal the ones ``create_all`` produces.** This
   is the real drift risk: tenants are provisioned two ways —
   ``tenant_provisioning._create_tenant_tables`` (``create_all``, fresh tenants)
   and Alembic (existing tenants) — and a hand-picked name in the migration
   would leave the two schemas permanently different.
4. **The index is usable for the production query's predicate.** Asserted under
   ``enable_seqscan = off``, which tests the SHAPE of the index against the
   shape of the predicate. The suite's tenants hold a handful of rows, where a
   seq scan is genuinely the cheaper plan — asserting the cost-based CHOICE
   there would be asserting a fiction, and the real-volume choice is the
   measurement recorded above.
