"""Per-vendor spend is grouped in SQL, and says what it could not convert.

Two related guarantees about the four surfaces that answer "what did we spend,
by vendor" — the CFO supplier-concentration tile (`GET /api/analytics/cfo`),
its drill-through (`/api/analytics/drill/spend_concentration`), the
`vendor_spend` CSV export (`/api/analytics/export/vendor_spend`) and the
emailed scheduled report (`services/scheduled_reports`):

1. **They group in SQL.** Each used to `SELECT` five columns of every invoice
   in the period and fold them in Python through
   `currency_conversion.vendor_rollup_to_reporting_currency` — a synchronous
   per-row loop inside an `async def`, the shape `docs/decisions.md` §103
   removed from the dashboard's own top-vendor tile. They now share ONE query
   builder, `vendor_spend_grouped_select`, whose `GROUP BY (vendor, currency)`
   applies the conversion rule inside Postgres.

   They cannot simply take a `LIMIT`: `compute_supplier_concentration` derives
   its denominator from the whole vendor set it is handed, so the builder
   returns every vendor and each caller slices for display afterwards.

2. **They disclose what they could not convert.** A foreign invoice with no
   usable rate lock is added at FACE value (`reporting_amount_for_row`'s
   flagged fallback). That fallback is only defensible if it is reported, so
   `VendorSpendEntry` carries an `unconverted_count`, and both JSON surfaces
   publish it — the tile as a whole-population count beside the shares it
   distorts, the drill-through both per row and for the whole period. (The
   CSV export does not yet carry a column for it; `report_export` owns that
   header.)

The equivalence tests compare the SQL against the row-at-a-time helper kept in
`currency_conversion` for exactly that purpose. Books are randomised with
INDEPENDENT dimensions (vendor, amount, status, date, currency, lock state) —
correlated generators are how an aggregation bug hides (`docs/decisions.md`
§82): if every EUR invoice also happened to be the largest, a mis-keyed
`GROUP BY` would still look right.

DO NOT run this file standalone in a concurrent build — the `realdb` fixture
truncates all tables sequentially. The orchestrator runs the suite at the end.
