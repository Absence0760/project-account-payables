"""Outbound notification legs run AFTER the caller's transaction commits.

`workflow_engine.transition_invoice` used to `await` the whole notification
fan-out — one email per recipient, serially, then a Slack/Teams POST with a
10-second httpx timeout — *inside* the caller's still-open transaction.
`payment_erp_sync._sync_one_payment` holds `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` on the invoice
until after the transition returns, and `review.approve_invoice` holds it on the
`WorkflowInstance`, so a hung chat webhook held a row lock on a live invoice for
its full timeout and N recipients multiplied the email leg linearly.

The observable contract, which these tests pin:

  * nothing is sent before the caller commits;
  * everything is sent after it commits;
  * a transaction that ROLLS BACK sends nothing at all — we do not email people
    about a status change that never happened;
  * the in-app `Notification` rows still ride the caller's commit, because they
    are DB writes and should.

Plus a drift guard: the two dispatch modules must not regain a direct `await`
of a transport at module scope of the in-transaction path.
