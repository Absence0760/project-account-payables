"""End-to-end regression cover for the three virtual-card money-path defects
closed by PR #356 (tracker issue #321).

The pure decision functions are pinned in `test_card_rebate_base.py` and
`test_card_settlement_expiry.py`; the single-currency dashboard shape is pinned
against a mocked session in `test_card_dashboard.py`. This file drives the same
three fixes through the REAL code paths — the payment-run card leg, the signed
settlement webhook, and the dashboard's own SQL against a live Postgres — so a
regression that keeps the helpers intact while rewiring the call sites still
fails.

The three defects:

1. **The rebate base was the AUTHORIZED figure, and its fallback was the card's
   LIMIT.** `card.amount_charged or card.amount_limit`: `amount_charged` is
   stamped by the authorization event and was never updated at settlement, and
   the `or` reached for the authorization ceiling — a $10,000 card that settled
   $100 earned a rebate on $10,000.
2. **`card_settlement_block` ignored `expires_at`.** An aged-out card was a
   valid settlement target, so the payment went `completed` and the invoice
   `paid` while the vendor was never paid — worse than the double-spend the
   status check prevents, because there is no charge to reconcile against.
3. **`GET /api/cards/dashboard` mixed currencies.** Bare cross-currency `SUM`s
   over `amount_limit` / `amount_charged` / `CardRebate.amount` under no
   currency code at all.

Runs against the opt-in `realdb` fixture (skips without `pnpm db:up`).
