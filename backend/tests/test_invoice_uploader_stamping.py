"""Drift guard: every ``Invoice(...)`` site states who created the row.

``approval_chain.violates_segregation`` returns False — no breach — when
``Invoice.uploaded_by_id`` is NULL. That branch reads fail-open on a fraud
control, and it is only sound because of an invariant that lives nowhere in the
type system: **an invoice created on behalf of a signed-in employee always
records that employee**, so NULL provably means "nobody who could approve this
made it".

``services/csv_import`` violated that invariant silently for the whole life of
the CSV importer — the route had the user, the audit row used it, and the
``Invoice(...)`` constructor simply didn't pass it — so an AP manager could
import a payable at ``new`` and immediately approve it, while the same person
doing the same thing through ``POST /api/invoices`` got a 403.

Failing CLOSED on NULL instead would take out email intake, inbound PEPPOL and
the supplier portal, none of which have a control-plane user to record. So the
enforcement is here: a new construction site must pass ``uploaded_by_id``
explicitly, and passing a literal ``None`` must be declared below with the
reason there is no employee actor.

The recurring sweep was the fourth path on that list until migration 0096, and
it was the one that did not belong: nobody *ran* the sweep, but an employee
*authored* the template, and that is the person segregation has to exclude.
``recurring_invoice_templates.created_by_user_id`` now records the author and
``generate_one`` stamps ``actor_id or template.created_by_user_id``, so the
sweep's invoices name a creator. That is why ``recurring_invoices.py`` is
asserted below to pass a *value* rather than being excused here.
