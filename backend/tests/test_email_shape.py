"""The email shape check has one owner, and its permissiveness is deliberate.

`app/utils/emails.py` replaced three identical copies of the same regex —
`api/signup.py`, `api/partner.py` and `schemas/scheduled_report.py`. All three
decide **who receives a tenant's data by email** (a new tenant's admin, a
partner-provisioned child's admin, and the recurring CSV of a tenant's AP
spend), so the risk was never that the rule is loose; it is that three copies
of a loose rule drift and only one of them gets tightened.

Two halves, both load-bearing:

* the REJECTS pin what the check is for — no `@`, whitespace, a bare hostname,
  a trailing dot;
* the ADMITS pin what it deliberately lets through. `a@b.c`, a single-label TLD
  and an address with no MX record all pass, because shape is not
  deliverability and the real validation is the round trip (signup and partner
  provisioning both mail a link that must be clicked). Anyone tightening the
  rule has to edit a *failing* test here, which is the point: the tightening
  becomes a conscious call about who can still be mailed rather than a silent
  narrowing.

The third test is the drift guard — it fails if a fourth copy of the pattern
appears anywhere under `app/`, which is how this got to three copies.
