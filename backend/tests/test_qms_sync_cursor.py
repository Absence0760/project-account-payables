"""Incremental pull + audit-write discipline for the QMS inspection sync.

Three defects, all confirmed readings of the pre-fix code:

  a. ``run_qms_sync_once(*, since=None)`` accepted a cursor and never referenced
     it; ``_sweep_tenant`` took none; ``adapter.fetch_inspections()`` was called
     with no argument even though the adapter contract has been
     ``fetch_inspections(*, since=None)`` from the start. Every tick re-fetched
     each tenant's entire inspection history.
  b. The ``quality_inspection.synced`` audit write was unconditional, with
     ``change`` reading ``"updated"`` even when nothing had changed — so each
     tick appended ``len(records)`` rows to ``audit_log``, a table migration
     0022's BEFORE-DELETE trigger makes undeletable and the audit shipper drains
     to a WORM store. Unbounded growth describing no state change.
  c. ``sync_tenant_inspections`` computed a ``skipped`` count that
     ``run_qms_sync_once`` then discarded, so a provider emitting an unmappable
     disposition for every record produced a clean, entirely empty sweep result.

``FEOH_QMS_SYNC_ENABLED`` is off by default, so the result shape is free to
change; the manual ``POST /api/inspections/sync`` route is deliberately a FULL
re-pull and is asserted as such.
