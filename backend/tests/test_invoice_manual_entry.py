"""Real-DB coverage for manually-entered invoices (no OCR/extraction).

`POST /api/invoices` already created a fully-keyed invoice at `new` status
with no file — this pins that path plus the new `POST /{id}/file` companion
endpoint that lets a manually-entered invoice carry its source document.
`attach_invoice_file` is attach-only: it refuses once the invoice already has
a file (409), and it never triggers extraction — a manually-entered invoice
stays exactly as keyed in.
