"""An approval refusal inside ``approve_invoice`` must escalate, not 403 out.

Every resolver's ``apply`` ends in ``review.approve_invoice``, which enforces
controls the resolver's own pre-checks do not: segregation of duties (the
uploader can't approve), the named-approver gate, and the max-amount / CFO
thresholds measured against the same-vendor rolling AGGREGATE (a resolver only
sees the single invoice). Each refusal is an ``HTTPException``.

The coordinator only caught ``NotApprovable``, so those propagated out of
``run_agent`` to the route: an AP manager who resolved an exception on an
invoice they had uploaded themselves got a bare 403, with the exception left
``open``, NO ``AgentDecision`` row, and nothing in the queue saying why — while
every other way an apply can fail records a decision and escalates.

The apply also runs in a SAVEPOINT now, because ``approve_invoice`` applies
``corrections`` (including ``amount``) BEFORE it enforces the thresholds. A
threshold refusal after an amount correction would otherwise be committed by the
escalation that follows — the agent's amount change persisted on an invoice
nobody approved.
