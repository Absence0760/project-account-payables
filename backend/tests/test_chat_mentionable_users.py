"""`GET /api/invoices/chat/mentionable-users` — the @mention picker's source.

The picker shipped with no source at all. `SupplierChatThread` derives its
candidates from a `members` prop that `InvoiceModal` filled from the admin
store's `users` — a list only `/admin` and `/workflows/[id]` ever load. Landing
on `/invoices` directly left the dropdown permanently empty; arriving via
`/admin` first made it work. Same feature, different behaviour by navigation
path.

Neither existing endpoint fits, which is why this one exists:

* `GET /api/admin/users` is `require_permission(user.manage)` and returns
  emails, roles and last-login. Every non-admin 403s (the identical bug already
  fixed once for the approver picker) and none of that payload belongs in a
  chat composer.
* `GET /api/invoices/assignable-reviewers` is PII-free but gated
  admin/ap_manager and scoped to holders of `invoice.approve`. Mentioning is
  broader in both directions: an ap_clerk or CFO can post to the thread yet
  could not read that list, and a clerk is a perfectly reasonable mention.

So the gate is `get_current_user` — exactly what posting a mention requires —
and the projection is id / full_name / is_active, nothing else.

The second half pinned here is the POST's own check: `mention_user_ids` was
validated as a well-formed UUID and nothing more, so any id at all could be
persisted onto `SupplierChatMessage.mentions` and read back on every GET of the
thread. Nothing leaked (`notify_event`'s recipient load is org-scoped), but the
record asserted a mention of someone who was never notified. Both halves now
read the same roster.

Requires the dev Postgres (`pnpm db:up`).
