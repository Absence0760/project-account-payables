"""Where `run_extraction` writes the `ExtractionUsage` billing meter.

`extraction_usage` is a TENANT table. It is not in
`tenant_provisioning.CONTROL_TABLES`, no Alembic revision creates it, and
`scripts/seed.py::create_control_tables` filters to the control set — so it is
created only by `provision_tenant`, in each tenant DB. `services/billing`'s
`rollup_usage` reads it there, alongside the sibling meter `card_rebates`.

It used to be written through a control-plane session, on the strength of a
comment claiming the table lived there. It does not: the INSERT raised
`UndefinedTableError` into `run_extraction`'s own `except Exception`, which
rolled the tenant transaction back, opened an `extraction_failed` exception and
transitioned the invoice to `failed`. A SUCCESSFUL extraction was recorded as a
failure, and platform billing's primary meter was permanently zero.

The whole previous version of this file asserted that broken placement, using an
`AsyncMock` for the control session — so no test ever executed the INSERT
against a real database. `test_extraction_usage_table_is_tenant_local` is the
guard that closes that gap: it asks Postgres where the table actually is.
