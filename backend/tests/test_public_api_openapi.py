"""Published OpenAPI spec + docs for the public ``/api/v1`` surface.

Covers:
  * the spec builder is SCOPED — only ``/api/v1`` paths, never the internal
    SPA API; no internal-only component schemas leak in
  * the spec describes the ``X-API-Key`` security scheme (applied globally),
    the ``V1Invoice`` shape (money as a JSON string), pagination params, a
    ``servers`` entry, and ``info.version == "v1"``
  * ``GET /api/v1/openapi.json`` serves it and ``GET /api/v1/docs`` renders a
    self-contained HTML reference — both gated by ``FEOH_PUBLIC_API_ENABLED``
    (404 when off)
  * the docs page loads NOTHING from another origin and runs no script, so it
    is readable under the platform's strict global CSP (it used to be
    ``get_swagger_ui_html``, whose only stylesheet/script/favicon are CDN URLs
    that ``default-src 'none'`` blocks — the page rendered blank)

These are pure / app-level — no DB harness needed (the spec is generated from
the route table, and the endpoints don't authenticate).
