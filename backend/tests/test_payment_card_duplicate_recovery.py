"""The payment-run virtual-card leg must survive a duplicate live card.

``uq_virtual_cards_one_live_per_invoice`` (migration 0067) is the DB backstop
that stops an invoice ever holding two LIVE virtual cards. The batch endpoint
``POST /api/cards/generate`` handles a trip of that index gracefully — it
pre-checks for an already-carded invoice and wraps the flush in a SAVEPOINT
(``app/api/cards.py``). The single-payment leg inside ``_execute_single_payment``
used to do NEITHER: it called the provider unconditionally and flushed the new
row bare.

Two consequences, both reachable today:

  1. *Sequential* — an invoice carded via ``POST /api/cards/generate`` and then
     included in a ``virtual_card`` payment run. The leg minted a SECOND
     provider card (real, spendable) and then failed to persist it: the
     IntegrityError left the row orphaned at the provider.
  2. *Either case* — the IntegrityError poisoned the enclosing transaction. The
     loop's ``except Exception`` set ``payment.status = "failed"``, but the very
     next statement (``dispatch_audit``) and the per-payment ``db.commit()`` run
     on a session that now demands a rollback, so ``PendingRollbackError``
     escaped ``_dispatch_run_payments`` entirely. The run never rolled up, stayed
     ``executing``, and the failed status never persisted — so a ``/resume`` just
     re-drove the same payment into the same crash. Permanently stuck.

These tests drive the real ``execute_payment_run`` against a live Postgres so
the partial unique index actually fires.
