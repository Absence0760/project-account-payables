"""`PaymentRun.status` must describe the run's own payments.

Two halves of one round-10 finding.

**The rollup failed open.** `PaymentRunRollup.run_status` returned `completed`
whenever nothing was completed, failed or in flight — a fail-open default on a
money-run status. A run with every payment still `pending` (nothing attempted)
and a run with no payments at all both reported success without a cent moving.

**Nothing recomputed the persisted status.** `_dispatch_run_payments`' final
rollup is the only writer; neither the webhook, the reconciler, nor
`/compliance/{release,dismiss}` touched it. So a run that rolled up `submitted`
(one payment held `pending_compliance`) and then had that payment dismissed
reported `status: "submitted"`, `payments_failed: 1`, `retryable_failures: 1` —
and `/retry-failed` 409ed because `RETRYABLE_RUN_STATUSES` is
`("partial", "failed")`, while `/resume` and `/execute` 409ed on the claim
states. A dead end, and precisely the "button that can't act" the
`retryable_failures` field exists to prevent.

Requires the dev Postgres (`pnpm db:up`) for the endpoint half; the rollup half
is pure.
