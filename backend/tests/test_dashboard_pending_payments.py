"""The dashboard's `total_pending` covers every in-flight payment status.

`GET /api/dashboard` restated the in-flight set as `["pending", "processing"]`
while `api/payments.PENDING_PAYMENT_STATUSES` is the canonical
`("pending", "processing", "submitted", "pending_compliance")`. The two extra
statuses are not edge cases: `submitted` is money already handed to the rail,
and `pending_compliance` is money the sanctions/KYC gate is holding for a human.
Both showed in NEITHER dashboard KPI — not `total_paid`, not `total_pending` —
so they simply vanished from the landing page, which is the failure
`/payments/summary` already documents where the tuple is defined.

DO NOT run this file standalone in a concurrent build — the ``realdb`` fixture
truncates all tables sequentially. The orchestrator runs the suite at the end.
