"""Workflow / invoice state-machine integrity tests.

The invoice status state machine is the load-bearing structure of the
AP pipeline. Every legal status transition must (a) be in
`VALID_TRANSITIONS`, (b) emit an audit row, and (c) preserve the
`WorkflowInstance.steps_config_snapshot` so an in-flight invoice is
not retroactively affected by a definition edit.

Tests:
  - `validate_transition` rejects forbidden transitions
  - Each terminal status has no outgoing edges
  - The done status is a true sink
  - `transition_invoice` writes the audit row before returning
  - The graph contains no edges TO `new` from any state except
    `rejected` (resets are explicit)
  - Step-type config carries `require_segregation` (segregation of
    duties default — see workflow_engine DEFAULT_STEPS_CONFIG)
  - Workflow snapshot is JSONB on the WorkflowInstance model and
    independent from the live definition
