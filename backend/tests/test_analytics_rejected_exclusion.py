"""Rejected invoices are excluded from spend aggregates consistently.

The headline CFO `total_spend` already excluded rejected invoices, but the
dashboard's vendor-spend and the CFO supplier-concentration denominator did
not — so the same response disagreed with itself (a rejected invoice inflated
vendor spend / understated concentration shares). These realdb tests pin the
consistent exclusion across both surfaces.
