"""The backend resolves "today" in UTC, and stays that way.

`date.today()` uses the SERVER's local timezone. On a UTC container — the
deployed shape — that agrees with `datetime.now(UTC).date()`, so a mixture is
latent rather than live. That is exactly what makes it easy to keep
reintroducing, and it stops being latent the moment anything runs off a non-UTC
host, because these modules derive more than a display value from "today":

  * `api/analytics._commitment_rows` bounds its horizon on it, so the `/cfo`
    chart and a copilot answer built minutes apart can be assembled from
    different row sets for part of each day;
  * `services/cash_flow_plan.compute_plan_id` hashes it, so a plan proposed near
    midnight can 409 as stale against its own enact call;
  * `services/scheduled_reports` slices each report's `period_days` window from
    it, so the emailed snapshot and the API export of the same report disagree
    at the boundary.

`app/utils/dates.utc_today()` is the one definition, and **the scan is now the
whole of `app/`** — no allowlist. It got there in two moves: the conversion
waves (the cash-flow stack, then the AP surfaces whose "today" is a comparison
rather than a label — the discount deadline, the past-due and future-date fraud
flags, the recurring period key that IS the generation idempotency guard, the
regulated `Invoice.approval_date`, plus the stamps and filenames that sit
beside a `datetime.now(UTC)` in the same response), and then the last six
modules that resolved UTC correctly but *inlined* `datetime.now(UTC).date()`
instead of importing the helper.

The allowlist was the right shape while the tree was mixed — it is how a module
got converted, one at a time, without the guard going red on the unconverted
rest. It is the wrong shape now that nothing under `app/` reads the local date:
an opt-in list cannot see a NEW module, and a new module is precisely where the
next `date.today()` arrives. A whole-tree scan has no such gap, and it costs
nothing to maintain.

`test_no_module_inlines_the_utc_today_expression` is the second half. A module
spelling `datetime.now(UTC).date()` is *correct*, so the local-today scan can
never flag it — but it is one careless edit (dropping the `UTC` argument) from
being silently wrong, and the edited line still reads as deliberate. One owner
removes the class rather than policing it.

Every scan in this file reports its result as "no offenders found", which is
also what a scan that looks at nothing reports. Three guards make that
distinguishable — the tree walk must visit at least `MIN_APP_MODULES` files,
the AST matcher must still flag a violation PLANTED in real app source (not
just in a one-line snippet), and the `datetime.now(UTC).date()` text needle
must still occur in the one module allowed to spell it. Without them, a moved
`APP_DIR` or a rewritten helper turns this whole file green and inert.

Shape borrowed from `tests/test_payment_methods.py`'s source scan.
