"""Real-DB coverage for GET /api/invoices/counts.

The list-page status chips ("All" + per-status) read this endpoint. It must
tally the *whole* tenant via a server-side GROUP BY — the previous
implementation counted client-side over the first page of results, so a
tenant with more invoices than the page window undercounted every chip.

These tests pin: an empty tenant returns zeros, mixed statuses tally per
status, and a status with more rows than the list page_size (25) is counted
in full — the exact case the old page-1 tally got wrong.
