"""Operator-run backfill of the CSV-import provenance marker (`meta["imported"]`).

The touchless rate counts an invoice as **native** — this platform's own work —
unless it carries `Invoice.meta["imported"]`, the marker `services/csv_import`
stamps on every row it creates (`docs/decisions.md` §81). The marker is only
written going forward, so a tenant that migrated its history *before* the marker
shipped still has that history in the metric's population.

There is deliberately **no automatic backfill**: the marker exists precisely so
provenance stops being guessed, and nothing in the data can identify those rows.
Status cannot (`done` / `paid` / `rejected` are each reachable both by import and
natively) and neither can creation time on its own — the tenant's own invoices
were being created before the migration too.

What *can* settle it is an assertion from someone who knows when the migration
ran. That is this tool: the **operator** names the tenant and asserts the cutover
instant, and every un-marked invoice created strictly before it is stamped.

    meta["imported"] = {
        "at": "<asserted cutover, ISO-8601 UTC>",
        "source": "operator_backfill",
        "asserted": true,
        "stamped_at": "<when this tool ran, ISO-8601 UTC>",
    }

`asserted: true` is the honest part of the record: `at` is what an operator SAID,
not what was observed, so a later reader can tell an asserted marker from one the
importer wrote at the moment of import.

**The assertion is the source of truth, and a wrong date mis-stamps rows.** A
cutover later than the real migration stamps native invoices as imported and
shrinks the metric's population; an earlier one leaves imported rows counted as
native. Nothing here can detect either — check the date against the migration
runbook before passing `--apply`.

Safety properties:

* **Dry run is the default.** A bare invocation only reports; `--apply` is the
  single switch that mutates.
* **One named tenant.** `--tenant <slug>` is required; there is no "all tenants".
* **Date-bounded.** Only invoices created strictly before `--cutover`.
* **Idempotent.** Rows already carrying the marker are excluded in SQL (and
  re-checked in Python), so a re-run never double-stamps and never overwrites an
  existing marker — whoever wrote it.

Usage (from `backend/`):

    python scripts/backfill_import_provenance.py --tenant acme --cutover 2026-09-05
    python scripts/backfill_import_provenance.py --tenant acme --cutover 2026-09-05 --apply
    python scripts/backfill_import_provenance.py --tenant acme \
        --cutover 2026-09-05T18:30:00+00:00 --apply
