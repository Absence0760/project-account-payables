"""One-shot CLI: reap invoices stuck in `pending` extraction.

The same logic the background reaper runs on a timer — exposed as a
script for ad-hoc cleanup, debugging, or environments where the reaper
loop hasn't been deployed yet (e.g. lambda extraction mode).

Usage (from `backend/`):

    python scripts/reap_stuck_extractions.py                 # FEOH_EXTRACTION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS
    python scripts/reap_stuck_extractions.py --threshold 60  # tighter cutoff (seconds)
    python scripts/reap_stuck_extractions.py --dry-run       # report without committing
"""

# Anchor THIS checkout's `backend/` on sys.path before `app` is imported below.
# Run as a script, sys.path[0] is `scripts/`, so `app` is not on sys.path at
# all — and a worktree reusing the primary checkout's `backend/.venv` resolves
# it through the editable install's baked-in `__editable___backend_0_1_0_finder`,
# acting on the WRONG tree with nothing on screen to say so. Inserted at 1 so
# the script's own directory keeps priority; idempotent, and a no-op in the
# checkout the venv was installed from.
#
# Deliberately NOT hoisted into a variable: ruff's E402 exempts `sys.path`
# manipulation before imports but not an assignment beside it, so naming the
# path here turns every import below into a lint error.
# See `frontend/tests-e2e/README.md` § Running from a worktree.
