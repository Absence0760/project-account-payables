"""Generate the frontend's e-invoice rule-code → message-key catalogue.

`decisions.md` §95 deleted the client's hand-written code→prose map when the 422
body became structured, and named the durable replacement: a map **generated
from the backend's own rule set**, so the catalogue cannot drift from the
validator. This is the generator; `app/services/e_invoice/rule_catalog.py` is
the enumeration it reads.

Two modes, one behaviour:

    python scripts/gen_einvoice_rule_messages.py            # write the file
    python scripts/gen_einvoice_rule_messages.py --check     # fail if stale

``--check`` is the drift guard, and it is what makes the whole arrangement
hold: add a rule to `en16931_rules.py` and this file's output changes, so CI
goes red until the catalogue is regenerated — at which point the new key does
not exist in `en.ts` and `pnpm check` goes red in turn (the generated map is
`satisfies Record<string, MessageKey>`), and once it does the locale-parity
test demands the other five translations. Three guards, each catching the step
after the one before it.

The generated map deliberately covers only the codes a client can IDENTIFY:
`error_payload` folds a rule id into `msg` but leaves a generic kind
(`missing` / `malformed` / …) unprefixed, and the app's shared `formatApiDetail`
keeps only `loc` + `msg`. The generic kinds are emitted as a separate exported
list rather than silently dropped, so a new one shows up as a diff here instead
of as an unmapped code nobody notices.
