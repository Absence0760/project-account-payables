"""One-shot operator migration for the FeohLedger rename.

The rename changed two physical identifiers that live in Postgres, not in code:

  * the control-plane database  ``account_payables`` -> ``feohledger``
  * every tenant database       ``ap_<slug>``        -> ``feoh_<slug>``

Renaming the databases alone is NOT enough. ``organizations.db_name`` in the
control plane stores each tenant's physical DB name, and ``get_tenant_engine``
resolves the tenant engine from that column. If the databases are renamed but
the column isn't, every tenant request fails to connect; if the column is
updated but the databases aren't, the same. This script does both, in the
order that keeps them consistent, so the two can't drift.

Safe by default:

  * **Dry-run unless ``--apply`` is passed.** The default run prints the exact
    plan (every rename it would perform) and touches nothing.
  * **Idempotent.** Already-renamed databases are reported as skipped, so a
    re-run after a partial failure completes the job instead of erroring.
  * **DDL sink is guarded.** Postgres identifiers can't be parameterized, so
    every name is validated against ``_assert_safe_db_name`` (the same
    allowlist ``tenant_provisioning`` uses) before it reaches an ALTER.
  * **Refuses to run against a live system by default.** ``ALTER DATABASE ...
    RENAME`` fails while any session is connected. Pass ``--force`` to
    terminate other backends first — only do that during a maintenance window
    with the app stopped.

Usage (from ``backend/``, venv active)::

    python scripts/rename_databases_to_feohledger.py            # dry run
    python scripts/rename_databases_to_feohledger.py --apply    # execute
    python scripts/rename_databases_to_feohledger.py --apply --force

Connection details come from ``FEOH_DATABASE_URL``'s host/port/user/password;
the script connects to the ``postgres`` maintenance database, because a
database cannot rename itself.
