"""Auditor-facing audit-trail endpoints (`/api/audit`).

SOX evidence surface for external auditors: per-invoice and date-range export
of the tenant ``audit_log``, in JSON or CSV. Distinct from the per-invoice
``GET /api/invoices/{id}/audit-log`` (operational UI) — this router carries its
own RBAC (export is admin/CFO only, the auditor-equivalent privilege) and is
itself audited (every export writes an ``audit.exported`` row).

All routes are reads — no money moves — so the idempotency invariant does not
bind here. Every audit query resolves the tenant DB via ``get_tenant_db``;
actor names/emails are resolved against the control DB exactly as the existing
endpoint does. No PUT/PATCH/DELETE is defined anywhere in this router, keeping
the audit trail GET-only.

    Provide either ``invoice_id`` (the invoice's whole correlation trail) or a
    ``start``/``end`` date range. The two are mutually exclusive. Validation
    errors are generic ("invalid range") and never echo entity values; a
    missing invoice returns 404 with no leaked data. The export itself is
    audited (``audit.exported``).

    ``format=pdf`` returns a formatted SOX audit-trail report (cover + summary +
    chronological table) for external auditors. It renders exactly the same
    already-sanitised export entries the JSON/CSV dialects do (PII is kept out of
    ``details`` at audit-write time) — no broader, no regulated value added.

    **The export streams, and is never capped.** The real use case is an annual
    SOX range — tens of thousands of rows — and this route used to materialise
    every one of them as an ORM object before writing a byte, then build the
    whole response body in memory on top of that. It is now read through a
    server-side cursor (``yield_per``, the mechanism the sibling
    ``/audit/verify-signatures`` already used) and JSON/CSV are emitted in
    bounded chunks as the rows arrive, so peak memory is a page, not a year.

    A ``LIMIT`` was the obvious alternative and is the wrong one: a silently
    short export is evidence an auditor would sign off on, which is worse than
    a slow one. Nothing here truncates, and a run that fails part-way cannot
    pass for a complete one either — the response is chunked (no
    ``Content-Length``), so an aborted body has no terminating chunk and every
    conforming client raises a transport error, and the JSON dialect
    additionally never emits its closing ``]``.

    The number of queries is fixed regardless of range size: the snapshot
    ``now()``, one aggregate carrying both the row ``COUNT`` and the range's
    ``DISTINCT actor_id`` set, one batched actor lookup on the control DB, and
    the streamed cursor. Resolving actor names used to require a second pass

    tests it (over a period's whole population of approvals) had no surface at

    This sweeps every ``invoice.approved`` audit row in ``start``..``end``,

    ``unsigned`` both zero — is the evidence; a non-zero count names exactly the
    rows to investigate.

    Rows are streamed (``yield_per``), so the counts cover the whole population
    without materialising it. ``findings`` is capped by ``limit`` and flags
    ``findings_truncated`` when there were more; the counts are never truncated.

    ``unsigned`` is reported separately from ``invalid``: an approval written
    before ``FEOH_APPROVAL_SIGNING_KEY`` was configured has nothing to verify and
