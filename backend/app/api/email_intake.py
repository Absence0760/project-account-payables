"""Email-intake webhooks + org-admin token management.

Two classes of endpoint:

1. ``POST /api/email-intake/inbound/{provider}`` — PUBLIC, no JWT.
   Called by the email provider (SES via SNS, Mailgun, etc). Security
   is HMAC-signature verification of the body, plus the opaque
   per-tenant token embedded in the recipient address. Both layers are
   required in prod — see backend/docs/email-intake.md.

2. ``/api/organization/email-intake/*`` — JWT-authenticated, admin only.
   Shows the current intake address and rotates the token on demand
   (e.g. after a suspected leak).

    """Bodyless ``503`` — the ONE outcome that is not a decision.

    A decision (unknown token, duplicate, no usable attachment, success) is a
    final answer about *this* message and gets the uniform ack above. A failure
    of OURS — S3 unreachable, the tenant DB down, Redis flapping — is not an
    answer at all: the message is still the vendor's unprocessed invoice.

    ``email_intake.process_inbound_email`` already releases its Redis dedup
    claim and re-raises on exactly those failures, commenting that this "lets
    the NEXT delivery of the same message_id actually retry the work". Acking
    ``200`` told SES / Mailgun the message was delivered, so there *was* no next
    delivery: the release-on-failure code was preparing for a retry that could
    never come, and the invoice was gone with only a log line behind it.

    The trade-off this reopens is bounded and deliberate. The uniform ack exists
    because the intake signing secret is platform-wide, so a response that
    varies by outcome is an oracle for a per-tenant intake token. A 5xx on OUR
    failure narrows that oracle to "while the platform is already broken" — an
    attacker learns only that something inside us threw, never whose token they
    guessed, and only during an outage. Losing every invoice that arrives during
    a blip is the larger harm. ``api/billing_webhook.py`` faced the identical
    choice and went this way already; ``api/erp_webhook.py`` now matches.

    Bodyless so the response itself still carries nothing — no detail, no stack
    trace, no tenant.
