"""Partner / reseller multi-tenant admin (white-label).

A *partner* (reseller) org administers a set of branded *child* tenants. The
relationship is the nullable self-FK ``Organization.parent_org_id`` (migration
0065, control plane): a child points at its parent; a partner is any org
referenced by >= 1 child.

Trust model (the load-bearing point): the caller's org is resolved by the
standard ``get_tenant`` chokepoint, which cross-checks the JWT ``org`` claim
against the resolved tenant — so a partner admin authenticates as, and can only
act as, *their own* partner org. EVERY child query in this module is then
scoped ``Organization.parent_org_id == partner.id``: a partner can never see or
mutate an org it didn't parent. Looking up a non-child org id yields the same
opaque 404 as a missing one (no cross-tenant enumeration).

Each child's branding write lands on the CHILD org's control-plane row
(``settings.brand`` JSONB) and is audited into the CHILD's tenant trail —
exactly the same write + audit path as the child's own
``PUT /api/organization/branding``, just initiated by the parent. PII-free
audit (booleans only, never raw values). Admin-only on every mutation.

    Admin-only; scoped at the data layer to the caller's OWN children via

    detach a tenant it actually parents — a non-child / unknown id is the same
    opaque 404 as everywhere on this surface (no enumeration). Sets
    ``parent_org_id = NULL`` (back to standalone). Audited PII-free on BOTH
    trails. Idempotent: ``_resolve_child`` only matches while the link exists, so
    a second detach is a clean 404 (the link is already gone) — never a 500.
