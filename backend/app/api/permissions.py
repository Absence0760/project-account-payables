"""Granular permission catalog + system-role default-permission map.

This is the data layer behind ``require_permission`` (in ``deps.py``). It exists
to let an org *split* fraud-sensitive duties that are conflated inside a single
system role today — most importantly, that one ``ap_manager`` can both approve a
vendor bank-detail change (where the money goes) AND execute a payment run (the
money moving). A textbook segregation-of-duties violation that no amount of
whole-role bundling can fix; only a permission can.

Design (additive, backward-compatible):

* The catalog is **deliberately small** — only the sensitive, *splittable* set,
  not an exhaustive enumeration of every action. Everything not listed here
  stays on ``require_roles`` and behaves exactly as before.
* ``ROLE_DEFAULT_PERMISSIONS`` reproduces today's RBAC matrix for the four
  system roles *exactly*, so they resolve identically with zero behaviour
  change. System ``Role`` rows leave ``Role.permissions`` NULL and resolve via
  this map; a custom role stores an explicit list on the column.
* Effective permissions for a user = the union over all their roles (system via
  this map, custom via the stored list). Computed once in ``get_current_user``.

Keep the constants as the single source of truth — endpoints import these names,
never bare strings, so a typo is an ``ImportError`` not a silent always-deny.

#   payment void      require_roles(ADMIN, CFO)
#   payment-run approve (create draft) require_roles(ADMIN, AP_MANAGER, CFO)

#     `require_roles(ROLE_CFO)`, NOT this permission — the two "approve"
#     names collide but the actions don't: sign-off is the mandatory human
#     CFO check above the org's dollar threshold, and granting it to
#     whoever holds the broader create-draft permission (admin/ap_manager
#     by default) defeats that control. See the route's own docstring.
