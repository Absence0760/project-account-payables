    union `list_gl_accounts`, the AI extraction catalog and

    is unresolvable: nothing implements override semantics, and an invoice
    records the code as a STRING, so which account it was coded to becomes
    unanswerable.

    Two entities may still each hold their own ``6000`` — neither is in the
    other's effective chart, and separate subsidiaries running the same standard
    code is normal. In the consolidated view the union is the whole tenant, so
    creating a SHARED code that some entity already defines is refused: a shared
