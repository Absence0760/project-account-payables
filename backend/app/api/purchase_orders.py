    The PO itself is resolved through `_get_scoped_po`, so a sibling
    subsidiary's id is the same opaque 404 as an unknown one.

    ``linked_invoices`` is confined to the PO's OWN subsidiary
    (``po.entity_id``) ∪ unstamped rows — the ``services/vendor_matching``
    shape. It stays keyed on the PO rather than on the caller's header even now
    that the PO itself is entity-gated, because the consolidated view
    (``X-Entity-ID`` absent) legitimately reaches every PO and must still show
    each one only its own subsidiary's invoices.

    It has to be scoped at all because ``po_number`` is NOT unique across
    subsidiaries — ``services/po_matching`` explicitly designs around that (its
    own PO lookup is entity-scoped for exactly this reason, and two
    subsidiaries each numbering from ``PO-1001`` is the documented case).
    Joining on the number alone therefore listed a UK subsidiary's invoices —
    number, vendor and amount — on a US-scoped viewer's PO detail: a
    cross-entity read through a route that never consulted the entity selector
    at all.

    A NULL ``entity_id`` is admitted on the invoice side. There it means
    *unstamped* (pre-multi-entity, or created before the row carried an
    entity), not "shared", and excluding those would hide a real invoice from
    the one page that links it to its PO — under-showing here is silent, so
    NULL stays in. A NULL on the PO itself is a passthrough: every
    single-entity tenant is unchanged.

    The vendor is deliberately NOT also matched on. An invoice whose vendor
    disagrees with the PO's is precisely what a reviewer opens this panel to
    see; narrowing by vendor would hide it, and vendor is not a tenancy
    boundary.
