"""Dynamic discounting & early-payment optimization endpoints.

Surfaces the supplier-offered discount lifecycle (create / accept / decline),
the per-invoice ROI calculator, the cash-constrained optimizer, bulk vendor
negotiations, and the captured/missed/projected-savings dashboard.

All money is ``Decimal`` end-to-end; every mutation is RBAC-gated and writes an
audit row. Reads are entity-scoped (multi-entity). The ROI economics (days
accelerated = tier deadline → net due date) are shared verbatim with the
auto-capture sweep via ``discount_auto_trigger._tier_deadline`` /
``_resolve_due_date``. See ``backend/docs/dynamic-discounting.md``.
