"""Microsoft Teams interactive approval — approve / reject from the Teams card.

``POST /api/approvals/teams/interactivity`` — PUBLIC, no JWT.

When an invoice is assigned for review and the org's chat provider is Teams, the
approval card posted to the channel carries Approve / Reject actions (rendered by
``chat_notification_adapters/teams_adapter``). Each action's payload carries a
signed, single-use **action token** — the same primitive the email-approval link
and the Slack buttons use (:mod:`app.services.email_action_token`), bound to the
``teams`` channel and to the intended approver. The token IS the credential;
there is no JWT, no session, so this endpoint is public-by-design and lives in
``ALTERNATE_AUTH``.

Two gates, layered, both fail closed (the exact same posture as the Slack path):

1. **Teams request signature** — ``base64(hmac-sha256(base64decode(security
   token), raw_body))`` over the *raw* bytes, compared constant-time by the
   shared :mod:`app.services.teams_signature` primitive (the same function that
   signs the outbound card, so the two ends can't drift). It arrives on
   ``Authorization: HMAC <digest>`` from a Teams **Outgoing Webhook**, or on
   ``X-Feoh-Card-Signature`` from the approval card's own ``HttpPOST`` action —
   Teams may overwrite an actionable message's ``Authorization`` with its own
   bearer token, so the card carries both. When Teams includes an
   ``X-Teams-Request-Timestamp`` header we also reject stale timestamps
   (> ``teams_request_max_age_seconds``) to stop replay of a captured POST. No
   secret configured → the feature is OFF and every request is rejected.
2. **Action token** — verified exactly like the email/Slack path (HMAC + expiry +
   ``teams`` channel + single-use ``jti`` consume in Redis), then the
   approve/reject runs through the *normal* :mod:`app.services.review` path as the
   named reviewer, so segregation of duties, the approval thresholds, the CFO
   gate, the immutable audit row, and the approval digital signature all apply
   exactly as if they had logged in.

Every rejection path returns an opaque ``200`` ack (a Teams-friendly message
Activity) — never a 4xx — so a probe can't enumerate tenants, invoices, or which
secret/token shapes are accepted. Best-effort: it never crashes.

      ``X-Feoh-Card-Signature``, because Teams may replace an actionable
      message's ``Authorization`` header with its own bearer token (the acting
      user's identity) — which would otherwise strip the only proof we have.

    Collecting *candidates* rather than picking one is deliberate: a proxy may
    fold duplicate ``Authorization`` headers into one comma-joined value, so a
    first-match-wins read could hand the verifier a mangled string and never
    reach the card header behind it. A base64 digest never contains a comma, so
