"""PEPPOL AS4 inbound receive webhook (the receiver corner, C4).

``POST /api/peppol/inbound/{tenant_slug}`` — PUBLIC, no JWT.

Called by the receiver's Access Point (C3) when it delivers an inbound BIS
Billing 3.0 document to us. Security is the provider's HMAC signature over the
raw body (verified via :func:`peppol_receive.verify_inbound_signature` +
``webhook_security.extract_signature_header``). The tenant is encoded in the URL
path — each tenant configures its own inbound URL with the Access Point, so a
leaked URL only affects that one tenant (mirrors the payment webhook).

Every rejection path returns ``204`` silently with a PII-free ``logger.warning``
naming only a reason code — never a 4xx (which would enumerate which tenant
slugs / signing secrets / payload shapes are accepted) and never the supplier's
participant value / tax id / payload in the log or body.
