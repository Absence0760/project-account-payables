"""Quality Inspection endpoints — list, detail, create (4-way matching leg).

A QualityInspection is the 4th leg of 4-way matching (invoice vs PO vs Goods
Receipt vs Quality Inspection). ``po_matching.match_invoice_to_po`` reads the
most recent inspection for a PO/GR to drive pass/fail/partial outcomes; this
router is the CRUD surface that creates those rows. See
``backend/docs/po-matching.md``.

    ``{fetched, created, updated, unchanged, skipped}``.

    **A full re-pull, deliberately.** The background sweep is incremental — it
    passes each org's persisted ``settings.qms.last_synced_at`` high-water mark
    and advances it. This route passes no cursor and advances none: a human
    asking to sync now is asking for everything, usually *because* they suspect
    the incremental window missed something, and answering that with an empty
    result would be useless. Re-fetched records that match what is stored come
    back as ``unchanged`` and write neither a row nor an audit entry.

    **409 when the configured provider has no adapter**, too — the other half of
    the same guard. `get_qms_adapter` refuses a NAMED provider it has no adapter
    for rather than resolving to `mock` (`decisions.md` §29), and this route
    surfaces that as a 409 naming the bad value and the registered alternatives.
    An operator asked for this pull directly; answering with a clean all-zero
    summary would hide the reason it found nothing.

    **409 when the org has no QMS configured.** Opting in is the same rule the
    background sweep applies (`qms_sync.resolve_opted_in_qms_config`, shared so
    the two can't drift): an org-level `settings.qms` block, or a platform
    provider override. Without one, `get_qms_adapter(None)` resolves to the
    `mock` adapter, and a single call would persist its three fabricated
    fixtures against the tenant's real purchase orders — a synthetic `pass`
    clearing the 4-way quality gate on a real invoice, a synthetic `fail`
    flipping others to `mismatch`, both indistinguishable from real rows.
