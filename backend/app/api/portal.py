    **Public-by-design** (documented, like the SSO `/auth/sso/config` endpoint):
    the supplier-portal *login* page is unauthenticated, and portal users are
    `VendorUser` (a different identity from employee `User`s), so neither the
    employee-gated `GET /api/organization/branding` nor a JWT is available here.
    The tenant is resolved by the existing `get_tenant` chokepoint — the same
    `X-Tenant-Slug` header / custom-domain `Host` resolver the rest of the portal
    uses — so one tenant's host never returns another's brand. Unauthenticated
    requests are exempt from `get_tenant`'s JWT cross-check by design.

    Safe to be public: the response model is `BrandConfig`, which carries ONLY
    the six non-sensitive, already-DOM-safe white-label fields (product name,
    logo URL, accent hex colors, support/legal URLs). No org settings, secrets,
    or other-tenant data can structurally leak through it, and there is no
    enumeration surface — the resolver returns the one tenant the request
    already targets. An unset / malformed brand block degrades to all-empty
    (= platform defaults), so the portal always themes (fail-soft).

    Reuses `organization._resolve_brand`, the same validated parse the admin
    read/write path uses; the stored values were validated on write, and a
    persisted-but-now-invalid block is re-validated here and falls back to
    empty — never raising.

    Resolves the URL-safe token, returns the live PAN/CVV/expiry on the
    first hit, and marks the token used so a second visit returns
    `gone`. The token itself is the credential — no portal-auth dep
    here. Tokens expire after 7 days regardless of use.

    **Consume-then-fetch, fail-closed.** `consume_reveal_token` claims the token
    atomically (`UPDATE … WHERE used_at IS NULL … RETURNING`), and we COMMIT that
    claim — and the audit row for it — *before* calling the card provider. Two
    consequences, both deliberate:

    * Concurrency: of N simultaneous requests carrying the same token, exactly
      one can claim it, so the live PAN/CVV is retrievable at most once. The
      row lock is never held across the outbound provider call.
    * Durability: once the claim is committed, nothing downstream can un-burn
      the link — not a provider outage, not a failing commit after the PAN has
      already gone out on the wire, not a process crash. The cost is that a
      degraded reveal (cards disabled, provider down) still spends the link and
      the vendor must ask AP for a new one. That is the right trade: a link
      that survives a failed reveal is indistinguishable from a link that can
      be revealed twice, and this is live card data.

    The tenant is resolved by the `get_tenant` chokepoint (public-by-design,
    same as `/portal/branding`) and its `Organization` id is passed to
    `consume_reveal_token` as a defense-in-depth binding: the token AND the card
    it points at must both carry this tenant's org id, so a token can never be
    pivoted onto a card outside the resolved tenant even if the DB routing were
    ever wrong. It also gives us `tenant.settings` directly — no need for a raw
    control-plane session.

    Errors come back as small JSON bodies with stable shapes so the
    portal UI can show a sensible message:
      404 invalid    — wrong / unknown token
      410 used       — already revealed once
      410 expired    — past the expiry window
