"""Bank reconciliation endpoints (``/api/bank-reconciliation``).

Import a bank statement (CSV today; OFX / camt.053 reserved) and auto-match
its debit transactions against our own ``Payment`` rows, so the AP team can
confirm every payment we think we made actually cleared the bank — and catch
one that didn't (or one the bank shows that we have no record of).

All parsing + matching logic is pure and lives in
``app.services.bank_reconciliation`` (``parse_csv_statement`` /
``match_statement_transactions``, shared with no background sweep —
reconciliation is entirely user-triggered, same design as
``vendor_statement_recon``). Money is ``Decimal`` end-to-end; every mutation
is RBAC-gated and writes an audit row. See
``backend/docs/bank-reconciliation.md``.

Not entity-scoped: ``BankStatement`` / ``BankTransaction`` predate the
multi-entity work and cover an org-wide bank account, not a subsidiary's
books — mirrors how ``GLAccount`` treats an unscoped row as shared.

    ONE builder, and the list's row query and its ``total`` are both built from
    the object it returns — so a narrowed table can never be headed by a
    whole-set count (`docs/decisions.md` §48;
    ``tests/test_paginated_list_search_legs.py`` is the structural guard).
    Org scope is applied by the caller.

    ``account_identifier`` stays an EXACT match: it is the same value the
    upload form posts and the idempotency key is built from, so a caller
    holding an account label wants that account's statements and nothing else.
    ``search`` is the free-text sibling, and matches:

    * ``account_identifier`` — the row's primary rendered label, and the reason
      this leg exists: a partial account term ("operating", "1234") is what a
      reviewer actually types.
    * ``source_format`` — not a column on the tab, but the statement's own kind
      and part of the detail header the reviewer just came from. Direct
      analogue of the ``file_type`` leg on ``/positive-pay``; lets a tenant
      that mixes CSV and OFX imports narrow to one.
    * ``period_start`` / ``period_end`` rendered ISO (``YYYY-MM-DD``) — the
      honest half of the period column. The row renders a LOCALISED date, and
      matching that in SQL would make the result set depend on the caller's
      browser language (the same trap ``/positive-pay`` declined for its
      localised label), so the ISO form is matched instead: "2026-08" narrows
      to that month regardless of locale. Rendered with ``to_char`` rather than
      a plain cast, which would resolve against the Postgres session
      ``DateStyle`` and could hand back ``08-15-2026`` on a non-ISO server.

    ``currency`` is deliberately NOT searched: it is never shown on this tab,
    and a three-letter code is the highest-noise substring of the set — a
    two-character term would silently pull in every row of a currency the user
    never mentioned.

    Per-statement detail answers "did this file reconcile"; nothing answered
    "across everything we have imported, what has still not cleared" — the
    question month-end actually asks. Computed on read from the existing
    `BankTransaction.matched_payment_id` link, so there is no stored clearance
    column to drift out of sync when a payment is later voided or a match
    re-pointed.

      * ``uncleared_payments``  — we say it went out, no bank line claims it.
      * ``unmatched_debits``    — money left the account with no payment behind
                                  it (the never-issued-cheque shape).
      * ``discrepancies``       — identified, but it does not reconcile: the
                                  bank moved a different ``amount_mismatch``
                                  (positive variance = they took more), a
                                  different ``currency_mismatch``, or moved it
                                  against a payment our books say never went
                                  out (``status_conflict``). Each row carries
                                  its ``classification``.

    A payment linked to a discrepancy line is NOT uncleared — it is accounted
    for, in the discrepancy bucket — so it appears exactly once. Every linked
    line therefore lands in exactly one of the three buckets or none: nothing a
    reviewer needs to see can hide between them.

    Each bucket runs a SQL aggregate for its count + exact ``Decimal`` total
    and a separate ``LIMIT``-ed row query, so ``?limit`` truncates the rows
    only and nothing unbounded is ever loaded into memory — a month-end close
    on a large backlog is the exact shape this endpoint has to survive.
