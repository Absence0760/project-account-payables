    This is the release path that makes the ERP-sync hold safe to ship. When
    the rail settles less than AP authorized (or in a currency we never
    authorized), `settlement_coverage` says the invoice is not discharged and
    `payment_erp_sync` leaves it at `payment_scheduled` rather than reporting
    it settled in full. Without an exit that would be a permanent strand — the
    exact defect that forced the first attempt at this hold to be reverted,
    because nothing re-invokes that sweep once a run's payments are terminal.

    There are two legitimate exits and this is the one that keeps the money
    where it landed:

    * **Accept** (here) — the shortfall is agreed with the vendor, or the
      remainder is being handled outside this invoice. The invoice moves to
      `paid` and the `reason` is recorded on the immutable trail.
    * **Void** (`POST /api/payments/{id}/void`) — the settlement is wrong. The
      invoice returns to `approved` to be re-paid correctly. That path already
      accepts a `payment_scheduled` invoice, so it works while held.

    Deliberately does NOT resolve the `fraud_flag` the settlement discrepancy
    raised. Unlike `payment_compliance_hold` — a type only the compliance path
    ever raises — `fraud_flag` is shared with Positive Pay's altered-cheque
    detection, so clearing "the open one" here could silently close an
    unrelated fraud finding. The exception queue stays the separate human
    sign-off, and it writes its own append-only row when someone makes it.

    caller, `captured_amount`/`captured_at` never got set and the
    captured-savings KPI always read 0 even when discounts were genuinely
    accepted and paid at the discounted amount.

    Called from every path a `Payment` reaches `completed` — the synchronous
    adapter/card leg (`_execute_single_payment`) and the async webhook-driven
    completion (`payment_webhook`) — so a discount is recognized whether the
    rail confirms instantly or days later. Both callers already hold the
    `Invoice` and pass it in; `invoice=None` falls back to resolving it from
    `payment.invoice_id` for any future caller that doesn't. No invoice found
    is a no-op (nothing to match against); a payment amount that doesn't
    match a discounted payoff exactly is also a no-op (see
    `discount_capture.capture_offers_for_settled_payment`).

    NOT called when the settlement verifier flagged a discrepancy — the
    payoff match runs against OUR authorized amount, which a divergent
    settlement has just contradicted. See the call site in `payment_webhook`.

    Best-effort, like the vendor card-notify email below: this labels a
    payment that already, definitely settled with a bookkeeping fact
    (realized discount savings) — it must never be the reason a payment
    that DID move money fails to record that it moved (or, on the webhook
    path, the reason a webhook delivery 5xxs and gets needlessly retried).
    The invoice lookup lives INSIDE the try for exactly that reason. A
    failure here is logged (class only — no invoice/vendor PII) and
    swallowed rather than propagated, mirroring `notify_vendor_of_card`'s
    own safety net.

    This is the **exit for a stranded invoice**. `services/payment_erp_sync` is
    the only path that flips `payment_scheduled → paid`, and it is dispatched
    exactly once per terminal event (run execute, payment webhook) —
    fire-and-forget onto a detached thread. If a leg fails there, the money has
    already moved but the invoice never advances, the ERP is never told, and
    **nothing re-invokes the sync**, because the reconciler backstop only
    re-dispatches payments it moves out of `submitted`/`processing`.

    Voiding is not an exit for that state: `POST /{payment_id}/void` returns the
    invoice to `approved`, which invites a second payment for money that already
    left. So the strand gets an explicit, audited re-run instead.

    A failed leg now also opens a de-duped `erp_reconciliation` exception naming
    this endpoint, so the operator reaches it from the queue rather than having
    to know the run id. Deliberately does NOT resolve that exception on success
    — `erp_reconciliation` is shared with the ERP-void path in
    `api/erp_webhook`, so auto-closing "the open one" could silently clear an
    unrelated reconciliation (the same reasoning `POST /{id}/settlement/accept`
    documents for `fraud_flag`). The human closes it after confirming.

    **Idempotent by construction, not by a claim**: the pass skips every payment
    that isn't `completed` and every invoice that isn't `payment_scheduled`, so
    a repeat call after a successful re-run writes no second transition. It
    moves no money — it only reports money that already moved.

    Read `transitioned`, not `synced`, to answer "did this recover anything".
    `synced` counts legs whose ERP-facing work completed, which stays TRUE for a
    settled payment whose invoice was already `paid` — so a repeat call reports
    the same `synced` count and `transitioned: 0`.

    Unlike the two dispatch sites this one AWAITS the pass, so the response
    carries the real per-leg counts instead of "queued".

    """Re-attempt the safely-retryable FAILED payments of a `partial`/`failed` run.

    A payment run's failures were previously a dead end: the run settled on
    `partial`, and the only way forward was to hand-build a second run.

    **A retry books a NEW payment, it never re-arms the old one.**
    `Payment.correlation_id` is the PROCESSOR's idempotency key (see
    `payment_adapters/base.py`), so a re-attempt is genuinely a new order and
    needs a new one. Minting it onto the failed row — as this endpoint first
    did — also meant clearing `failure_reason`, `provider_payment_id`,
    `submitted_at` and `completed_at`, destroying the only handles anyone had
    for reconciling attempt #1 with the processor and overwriting two regulated
    money timestamps. Attempt #1 is therefore never written to at all; attempt
    #2 is an INSERT on the same run carrying `retry_of_payment_id`, and the run
    rollup counts the latest attempt per invoice
    (`services/payment_runs.active_run_payments`). `failed`/`cancelled` are
    outside `uq_payments_one_live_per_invoice`, so the second row is free to
    claim the invoice's live-payment slot.

    **What is re-attempted, and what is not.** Anything already `completed`,
    `submitted`, `processing` or `pending_compliance` is left exactly as it is
    and is never re-sent — the same guarantee `/resume` makes. A payment in
    `RETRYABLE_PAYMENT_STATUSES` is *skipped* (never re-sent, never mutated),
    with the reason surfaced in `skip_reasons`, when:

    - `invoice_not_payable` — the invoice is voided, re-rejected or already
      `done`, so paying it would move money against something nobody currently
      approves;
    - `invoice_has_blocking_exception` — an unresolved
      `PAYMENT_BLOCKING_EXCEPTION_TYPES` flag (duplicate / fraud_flag /
      line_total_mismatch). Run creation refuses these outright; this endpoint
      re-dispatches money days or weeks later, so a `fraud_flag` raised in the
      interim (a BEC bank-detail swap, an altered cheque off a Positive Pay
      return) has to stop the re-send here too. Same shared query
      (`payment_runs.blocked_invoice_ids`) so the two can't drift;
    - `needs_reconciliation` — we cannot prove the processor never accepted the
      original order (`classify_payment_failure`): a populated
      `provider_payment_id`, an `unexpected_error:*` / `*_transport_error:*` /
      `*_api_error:*` / `reconciler_max_age_exceeded*` reason, or any reason
      we don't recognise. Re-sending these under a fresh idempotency key is how
      one invoice gets paid twice. A human voids or reconciles first;
    - `net_amount_changed` — a credit memo applied since the run was built
      means the failed row's `amount` is no longer what the vendor is owed
      (`payment_runs.net_payable_amount`). The amount is never silently
      adjusted — a fresh run re-derives it through the full gate set;
    - `invoice_has_live_payment` — the invoice has since acquired another live
      payment. The savepoint around each insert is the backstop for the same
      conflict arriving as a race.

    **Idempotency.** The run is row-locked and claimed (`→ executing`) before
    anything is booked, so a double-click / concurrent retry blocks on the lock
    and then 409s against the non-retryable status — it can't produce a second
    dispatch pass. `_dispatch_run_payments` then re-locks each payment and skips
    any that is no longer `pending`.

    Auth is by the processor's HMAC signature (verified inside
    `adapter.parse_webhook`), not a JWT. The tenant is encoded in the URL
    path — each tenant configures its own webhook URL with the processor,
    so a leaked URL only affects that one tenant. Bad signatures, unknown
    events, and unknown tenants all return 204 silently — leaking the
    distinction would help an attacker probe for the right secret. Audit
    log captures the rejection.

    A verified signature authenticates the SENDER, not the CONTENT: a
    `completed` event proves the processor is talking to us about a payment
    we know, never that it moved the amount AP authorized. Every completion
    therefore runs `services/payment_settlement.verify_settlement` against
    the reported amount + currency, and a divergence opens a
    payment-blocking `fraud_flag` instead of being treated as a clean
    settlement. See `backend/docs/payments.md` § Settlement-amount
    verification.
