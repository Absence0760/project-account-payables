"""Scheduled-report CRUD — ``/api/analytics/scheduled-reports``.

The input surface for ``services/scheduled_reports``' runner. The runner has
been complete and tested for a while; nothing under ``app/api/`` referenced the
``ScheduledReport`` model, so a row could only be created by direct SQL,
``list_due_schedules`` returned ``[]`` on every tick forever, and the documented
5-strike auto-disable was a one-way door — an operator had no way to re-enable a
schedule the runner had switched off.

Design notes worth keeping:

- **Admin-only to mutate.** A schedule is a standing instruction to email a CSV
  of the tenant's AP spend to an arbitrary address on a recurring basis, with no
  further review of any individual send. That is a data-egress control, not a
  reporting preference, so it sits above the `_CFO_ROLES` gate the rest of
  ``/analytics`` uses. Reads are admin + CFO — the CFO owns the reports and
  needs to see (and audit) what is going out.
- **Tenant-scoped, deliberately NOT entity-scoped.** ``ScheduledReport`` has no
  ``entity_id`` and the runner's ``_materialise_rows`` applies no entity filter
  to any of its six report types — the emailed CSV is whole-tenant by
  construction. Stamping an entity on the schedule row would advertise a scope
  the delivered file does not honour, which is worse than not offering it.
  Making it real means entity-filtering the materializer AND a migration; that
  is its own slice. Tenant isolation itself is enforced the normal way, through
  the ``get_tenant_db`` chokepoint.
- **Validation is against the runner's own registries**, not restated copies —
  see ``app/schemas/scheduled_report.py``. A ``report_type`` outside
  ``report_export.EXPORTERS`` raises on every tick and burns the auto-disable
  without ever sending; an unknown ``cadence`` silently reschedules as daily.

Every mutation writes a PII-free audit row: recipient addresses are third-party
PII and never enter the trail — only their **count** does.

See ``backend/docs/analytics.md`` § Scheduled report delivery.
