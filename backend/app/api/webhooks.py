"""Outbound-webhook management — subscription CRUD + delivery log + redelivery.

Admin-facing endpoints, gated by the normal JWT session + ``require_roles(
ROLE_ADMIN)`` (NOT the X-API-Key path — outbound-webhook config is a
control-plane admin action). They operate on the control-plane
``webhook_subscriptions`` / ``webhook_deliveries`` tables.

Create returns the signing secret EXACTLY ONCE (like an API-key mint); list/get
responses carry only ``secret_prefix`` — never the full secret. Every mutation
writes an append-only, PII-free audit row.

    Only ``failed`` / ``dead`` deliveries can be redelivered — a re-send of an
    already-``delivered`` row would double-fire a side effect at the receiver.
    Resets the attempt counter and re-processes inline so the response reflects
    the new outcome.

    **The row is CLAIMED for the whole redelivery** (``FOR UPDATE``, held from
    the read until ``process_delivery`` commits), which is the same claim
    ``deliver_due`` and the emit path's immediate attempt take. This endpoint
    used to read the row unlocked, commit it back to ``pending`` with
    ``next_attempt_at = now()``, and only THEN POST — leaving a window in which
    the row was due, unclaimed and in flight, so a sweep tick landing there
    picked it up and POSTed the same delivery a second time, with both commits
    racing on ``attempt_count``. That is exactly the duplicate the claim was
    introduced to close on the other two paths; this one was left open.

    Holding the claim also serialises two admins hitting Redeliver at once: the
    second waits for the first to finish and then re-reads the row, instead of
    both passing the status guard on the same snapshot and both sending. What it
    sees is the first attempt's real outcome — ``delivered`` (or ``dead``) gives
    it the 409 the guard promises, while a first attempt that merely failed
    again leaves the row ``failed``, so the second click is a genuine second
    retry rather than a duplicate of an in-flight one.

    The trade-off is deliberate: because the requeue is no longer committed
    before the send, a failure in the send path's own commit rolls the row back
    to its pre-request state rather than leaving it queued for the sweep. That
    is the honest outcome — the admin sees the error and retries — and it is
    strictly better than a silent double-send.
