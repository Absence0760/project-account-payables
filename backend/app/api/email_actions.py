"""Email approval — approve / reject an assigned invoice from an email link.

``GET  /api/invoices/email-action/{token}``          — PUBLIC, renders a confirm page
``POST /api/invoices/email-action/{token}/confirm``  — PUBLIC, performs the action

The single-action token (built in :mod:`app.services.email_action_token`) IS the
credential — there is no JWT and no session, so both routes are public-by-design
and live in ``NO_AUTH_REQUIRED``. The token is HMAC-signed over the tenant +
invoice + reviewer + action + expiry, so it can't be forged or have its action
flipped.

Two-step on purpose: the **GET only renders an HTML confirmation page** — it
never mutates — so an email link-prefetcher or corporate security scanner that
issues a bare GET can't auto-approve an invoice. The state change happens only
on the **POST** the reviewer submits from that page.

The POST re-runs the *normal* :mod:`app.services.review` approve/reject path as
the reviewer named in the token, so segregation of duties, the approval
thresholds, the CFO gate, the immutable audit row, and the approval digital
signature all apply exactly as if they had logged in. Single-use is layered:
the workflow state machine (the invoice must be in ``ready_for_review``) plus a
Redis consume on the token ``jti`` (closes the reject→resubmit replay window).
