"""CFO + analytics endpoints.

The operational dashboard at `/api/dashboard` covers AP-clerk
metrics (pipeline, aging, recent payments). This module covers the
CFO surface: DPO trend, cash-conversion cycle, accruals, supplier
concentration, fraud-rate trend, rebate yield, forecast variance,
and the drill-through endpoints that let the CFO click through to
the contributing invoice / payment set.

Computation lives in `app/services/analytics.py` (pure functions).
This file does the SQL and the response shaping.

    Opening-balance resolution is the SHARED chain in
    `services/cashflow.py::resolve_opening_balance` — the same one the cash-flow
    copilot's tools and the projected-shortfall alert sweep use, so this
    dashboard, a copilot answer, and an alert email can never start from a
    different number. First hit wins:
      1. `opening_balance` query param (explicit BYO override) → `"explicit"`.
      2. Auto-sync from the org's configured payment/banking provider when its
         adapter supports the optional `get_balance` capability (the `mock`
         adapter returns a deterministic figure for local dev) → `"provider"`.
         Best-effort: a fetch failure / unsupported adapter silently falls
         through. Pass `seed_balance=false` to skip the provider call.
      3. Persisted `Organization.settings.cashflow.opening_balance` → `"settings"`.
      4. `0` with `opening_balance_source: "none"` so the UI prompts for one.

    A provider balance denominated in a currency other than the org's reporting
    currency is **refused** — every outflow subtracted from it here is in the
    reporting currency, so seeding the curve from a foreign account would make
    the running balance a silent two-currency mixture. The chain then falls
    through and `opening_balance_provider_skipped` reports
    `"currency_mismatch"`, so the fallback can't be mistaken for "no bank is
    connected". `opening_balance_currency` is therefore always the reporting
    currency the whole curve is denominated in.

    The alert threshold is the `min_balance_threshold` query param when supplied,
    else the org's persisted `settings.cashflow.min_balance_threshold` (managed
    via `GET/PUT /api/analytics/cash-position-settings`). Inflows (receivables)
