    This is a second entry point into card issuance — the other is the
    ``virtual_card`` leg of ``execute_payment_run`` in ``api/payments.py``.
    Both MUST enforce the same gates a card mint moves real money, so this
    handler reuses the same building blocks the payment-run executor uses
    rather than re-implementing them:

      - ``PAYABLE_INVOICE_STATUSES`` (from ``api/payments``) — the invoice
        must have cleared AP approval. An invoice still in
        new/pending/ready_for_review/rejected/failed is filtered out before
        any card is minted.
      - ``check_payment_compliance`` — sanctions/KYC/AML screening. Card
        issuance moves money just like an ACH/wire, so a blocked or
        sanctioned vendor must not receive a card; a hold/refuse verdict
        skips the invoice (mirrors the payment-run leg).
      - ``issue_card_for_invoice`` — the single adapter-dispatch + VirtualCard
        construction routine, so provider selection / expiry / entity
        propagation can't drift between the two entry points.
      - ``dispatch_audit`` — every other card-lifecycle event in this module
        (cancel, PAN reveal, webhook charge/settle) writes an append-only
        audit row; a direct mint must too (SOX trail).
