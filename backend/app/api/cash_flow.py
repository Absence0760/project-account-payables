"""AI Cash-Flow Copilot API — a thin, finance-leader-gated façade over the
existing conversational-assistant orchestrator.

Phase 1: two routes (`POST /api/cash-flow/copilot` + its SSE
`/stream` variant) that reuse ``app.services.assistant.orchestrator`` exactly
like ``app/api/assistant.py``'s ``chat`` / ``chat_stream`` — same deps
(``get_tenant_db`` / ``get_control_db`` / ``get_tenant`` / ``get_entity_id``),
the same tenant isolation + budget gate + audit trail + SSE contract — but
gated to finance-leader roles only (``admin`` / ``ap_manager`` / ``cfo`` — NOT
``ap_clerk``) and behind the ``FEOH_CASHFLOW_COPILOT_ENABLED`` kill switch (both
routes 404 when disabled, so the surface simply doesn't exist when off).

Phase 3: two enact routes (draft-run / capture-discounts) — see
``docs/cash-flow-copilot.md`` §5/§6 for the full safety model. Both take the
plan's own resolved defining parameters back in the body
(``CashFlowPlanReplay``), recompute the deterministic ``plan_id``
(``services.cash_flow_plan.compute_plan_id``), and 409 if it doesn't match
the URL — a stale/mismatched plan is refused rather than silently acted on.

Saved plans + plan-vs-actual: five further routes persist a proposal as a
FROZEN ``models.cash_plan.CashPlan`` snapshot (keyed BY the same deterministic
``plan_id``, never replacing it) and score it against what actually got paid.
Saving changes nothing about how a plan is *acted on* — the enact routes still
read no stored row.

Consolidated cross-entity mode: every route here accepts a ``consolidated``
scope — the whole legal group's cash rather than one subsidiary's slice, the
same posture ``services.cash_flow_alerts`` takes (``entity_id=None``) and
``GET /api/analytics/by-entity`` takes by ignoring ``X-Entity-ID``. On the chat
routes it is an explicit ``?consolidated=true`` query flag; on the plan routes
it is DISCOVERED, because ``plan_id`` already encodes the scope it was built
under — see ``_resolve_and_verify_plan``.
