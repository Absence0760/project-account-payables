"""Periodic access-review endpoints (`/api/access-reviews`) — SOX access control.

Two routes, both admin/CFO only (the reviewer privilege):

- ``GET /api/access-reviews`` — the computed review list: every user holding an
  elevated role, with their last *mutating* privileged action and a dormancy
  verdict. This is a sensitive read (it enumerates who holds privileged access),
  so it writes an ``access_review.viewed`` audit row via ``log_access``.
- ``POST /api/access-reviews/acknowledge`` — records that a reviewer completed
  the review for the period. Writes an ``access_review.completed`` audit row and
  stamps ``Organization.settings.access_review.last_completed_at`` (+ reviewer
  id) on the control-plane org row. Idempotent-friendly: re-acknowledging just
  re-stamps with the new timestamp + reviewer.

Both routes are GET/POST reads-or-settings only — no money moves — so the
idempotency-on-money invariant does not bind. The computed list resolves users
from the control DB and last-action timestamps from the tenant DB; the
acknowledge stamp is a control-plane settings write. Tenant isolation is enforced
by the injected ``get_tenant_db`` (which cross-checks the JWT ``org`` claim) plus
filtering every query by ``user.organization_id``.
