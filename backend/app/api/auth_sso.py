"""OIDC SSO — authorize + callback endpoints.

Flow:
    1. User clicks "Sign in with Okta/Microsoft" on the tenant login page.
    2. Browser hits GET /api/auth/sso/authorize?slug=<tenant>.
       Backend fetches the OIDC discovery doc, mints state + nonce in Redis,
       and 302-redirects the browser to the IdP's authorization endpoint.
       `slug` is OPTIONAL: on a tenant's white-label vanity host there is no
       slug anywhere in the URL, so the tenant is resolved from the request
       `Host` against `settings.brand.custom_domains` instead (the same
       resolver `app/tenant.py` uses).
    3. User authenticates with the IdP; IdP redirects back to our fixed
       callback path (FEOH_PUBLIC_URL + FEOH_SSO_REDIRECT_PATH) with code + state.
    4. Frontend callback page calls POST /api/auth/sso/callback with code+state.
       Backend consumes state (single-use), exchanges code for tokens,
       validates the ID token signature + claims, JIT-provisions the user,
       and returns our own JWT + the tenant slug to redirect to.

The redirect target (frontend /login/sso-callback) is a static path, not
per-tenant — IdPs only need one redirect URI registered per app. Its *origin*
is the global `FEOH_TENANT_URL_TEMPLATE` unless the tenant has opted into
`settings.brand.sso_callback_base_url`, which is a value registered at the
customer's IdP and so is never inferred from a vanity host — see
`services/sso.sso_callback_base` and `docs/decisions.md` §91.
