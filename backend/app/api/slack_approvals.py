"""Slack interactive approval — approve / reject from the Slack message buttons.

``POST /api/approvals/slack/interactivity`` — PUBLIC, no JWT.

When an invoice is assigned for review and the org's chat provider is Slack, the
approval message carries Block Kit Approve / Reject buttons (rendered by
``chat_notification_adapters/slack_adapter``). Each button's ``value`` is a
signed, single-use **action token** — the same primitive the email-approval link
uses (:mod:`app.services.email_action_token`), bound to the ``slack`` channel and
to the intended approver. The token IS the credential; there is no JWT, no
session, so this endpoint is public-by-design and lives in ``NO_AUTH_REQUIRED``.

Two gates, layered, both fail closed:

1. **Slack request signature** — Slack signs every interactivity POST as
   ``X-Slack-Signature: v0=<hmac-sha256 over "v0:{X-Slack-Request-Timestamp}:{raw_body}">``
   with the app's *signing secret* (``FEOH_SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET``). We verify it
   with the shared constant-time HMAC helper and reject stale timestamps
   (> ``slack_request_max_age_seconds``) to stop replay of a captured POST. No
   secret configured → the feature is OFF and every request is rejected.
2. **Action token** — verified exactly like the email-confirm path (HMAC +
   expiry + ``slack`` channel + single-use ``jti`` consume in Redis), then the
   approve/reject runs through the *normal* :mod:`app.services.review` path as
   the named reviewer, so segregation of duties, the approval thresholds, the
   CFO gate, the immutable audit row, and the approval digital signature all
   apply exactly as if they had logged in.

Every rejection path returns an opaque ``200`` ack (a Slack-friendly ephemeral
message) — never a 4xx — so a probe can't enumerate tenants, invoices, or which
secret/token shapes are accepted. Best-effort: it never crashes.
