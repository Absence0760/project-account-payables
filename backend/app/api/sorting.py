"""Canonical column sorting for list endpoints.

Every sortable list endpoint shares ONE contract, mirroring
``api/pagination.py``:

- query params ``sort`` (a client-facing column key) and ``order``
  (``asc`` | ``desc``, default ``desc``)
- the column a ``sort`` key maps to comes from a per-endpoint allowlist —
  the raw query param is NEVER interpolated into SQL, and a key outside the
  allowlist is a 422 naming the ones that are accepted (not a silent
  fallback to the default order, which would leave a caller believing it
  sorted by something it didn't)
- the row's own primary key is ALWAYS appended as the final sort key,
  regardless of which column the caller picked — the same reasoning behind
  the existing `.id` tie-breaker on every list endpoint's default order
  (`created_at` alone isn't unique enough to make OFFSET/LIMIT pagination
  deterministic; neither is any other sortable column here). Without it, two
  rows tied on the chosen column could be reordered between pages by
  Postgres, duplicating one row onto two pages or skipping another.

Use :func:`sort_params` as the FastAPI dependency and :func:`resolve_order_by`
to turn the validated input into an ``ORDER BY`` clause list.

    column. An unrecognised key is refused with a 422 naming the accepted
