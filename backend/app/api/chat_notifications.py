# security-patterns.sh opt-outs (noqa: webhook-no-hmac) (noqa: webhook-no-dedup) — see docstring
"""Chat-notification settings + webhook-credential rotation.

The two `webhook-*` opt-outs on line 1 are deliberate and scoped to this module.
The `security-patterns.sh` rules that fire on a route path containing "webhook"
exist for **inbound** receivers, which are public-by-design and therefore need
an HMAC check and an event-id dedupe. Nothing here receives anything: these are
JWT + `require_roles(ROLE_ADMIN)` management endpoints for an **outbound**
destination we POST to. There is no provider signature to verify and no event
to dedupe. (`api/webhooks.py`, the outbound-subscription CRUD, is the same
shape and only escapes the rule because its paths don't spell the word.)

Mounted at `/api/organization/chat-notifications`, mirroring how
`api/email_intake.py` hangs its admin surface off `/api/organization/...`.

What lives here
---------------
`Organization.settings.chat_notifications` holds the org's Slack / Teams
fan-out config **and** `webhook_url`, which is the credential for both real
providers — a bearer capability that lets whoever holds it post arbitrary
content into the customer's approval channel. Before this module the URL was
settable only by overwriting the settings JSON through the generic
`PATCH /api/organization`, which meant recovering from a leak was an untracked
hand-edit that nothing audited.

The shape rules (write-only, preserved across a config save, never logged
beyond its hostname) live in the pure `services/chat_notifications_config`;
this module does persistence, RBAC and the audit write. See
`backend/docs/notifications.md` § Rotating the webhook URL and
`docs/secrets-rotation.md`.

    **There is deliberately no overlap window**, unlike

    posting every approval event to the compromised channel as well — the
