"""One definition of "where does this tenant's app live?".

Every outbound link this backend builds for a tenant — the signup welcome
email, the admin "you've been invited" email, the supplier-portal invite, the
password-reset link, the virtual-card reveal link, the supplier-chat portal
link, the Slack/Teams approval deep link — used to substitute ``{slug}`` into
the single global ``FEOH_TENANT_URL_TEMPLATE`` at its own call site. That is
fine for a platform-subdomain tenant and wrong for a white-label one: a tenant
reachable at its own vanity hostname still got every link pointing back at
``<slug>.<platform-domain>``, which works but undoes the white-label the custom
domain was bought for.

So the base URL is resolved here, once, from two sources in order:

1. the per-org override ``Organization.settings.brand.tenant_url_template``
   (managed by ``PUT /api/organization/branding``), and
2. the global ``FEOH_TENANT_URL_TEMPLATE``.

``{slug}`` is **optional** in the per-org value — a vanity host is a complete
base URL with no slug in it (``https://ap.acmecorp.com``), while the global
template is slug-shaped by construction (``https://{slug}.app.example.com``).
Both go through the same rule: substitute if the placeholder is present, use
verbatim if it is not.

Two deliberate non-callers, both guarded by
``tests/test_tenant_url_resolver.py``:

* ``app/services/sso.py`` — the OIDC ``redirect_uri`` and the SAML bridge URL
  are values *registered with the customer's IdP*. Silently re-pointing them at
  a vanity host would break every SSO login until the operator re-registered
  the app, so that move is an operator-sequenced migration, not a config read.
* ``app/main.py`` — the public signup config endpoint hands the raw global
  template to the unauthenticated signup page, which is deriving the shape of a
  hostname for a tenant that does not exist yet. There is no org to override
  from.
