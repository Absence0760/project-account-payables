# before calling here, so the helper should own the property rather than leave
# each caller to remember), every ASCII control character (0x00-0x1F, 0x7F —

    value from an untrusted filename (e.g. a vendor-supplied / AI-extracted
    ``invoice_number``).

    A raw ``f'attachment; filename="{name}"'`` has two failure modes:

    1. A `"` (or `\\`) in ``name`` breaks the quoted-string syntax, so some
       HTTP clients save the file under a truncated or mangled name.
    2. Non-ASCII characters aren't valid in the legacy ``filename=`` form.

    Fixed per RFC 6266 / RFC 5987 by emitting both parameters: a sanitized
    ASCII ``filename=`` fallback (unsafe / non-ASCII characters replaced
    with ``_``) for clients that only understand the legacy form, and a
    percent-encoded UTF-8 ``filename*=`` for clients that support it — which
    always takes precedence when present, so the true characters still
    round-trip for any modern client.
