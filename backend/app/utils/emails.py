r"""One definition of "does this look like an email address" for the backend.

Three modules used to carry their own copy of the same regex — ``api/signup.py``
(who gets a tenant), ``api/partner.py`` (who administers a partner-provisioned
child tenant) and ``schemas/scheduled_report.py`` (who receives a recurring CSV
of the tenant's AP spend). All three decide **who receives a tenant's data**, so
three copies of one rule is exactly the shape that drifts: tighten one and the
other two keep admitting what it now refuses, silently.

The check is deliberately **permissive**. It exists to reject obvious garbage —
no ``@``, whitespace, a bare hostname, a trailing dot — not to decide
deliverability. The real validation is a round trip: signup and partner
provisioning both mail the address a link that must be clicked, and a scheduled
report that can't be delivered surfaces as a delivery failure on the schedule.
Pulling in ``email-validator`` to be stricter would buy syntax rigour the RFC
itself makes nearly unusable (quoted local parts, address literals) without
answering the question anyone actually cares about.

The domain side uses non-dot character classes delimited by literal dots rather
than a nested quantifier, so the engine can't backtrack catastrophically on an
adversarial input (the polynomial-ReDoS pattern). Keep that shape if the rule
is ever tightened.

One deliberate tightening came with the hoist: the three copies all ended in
``$``, which in Python matches at end-of-string **or just before a trailing
newline** — so ``"user@example.com\n"`` passed all three shape checks and was
stored as a login, a partner child's admin address, or a report recipient. The
shared pattern ends in ``\Z`` instead, which matches only the true end. A
trailing newline in an address is never legitimate input, and a newline in a
value that reaches an SMTP header is the header-injection primitive, so the
narrower anchor is the safe end of the trade.

``tests/test_email_shape.py`` pins the behaviour in both directions — including
the cases this pattern deliberately ADMITS — so a later tightening is a
conscious edit to a failing test rather than a silent change in who can be
mailed.

    can legitimately assert an internal-only address like ``user@intranet`` with
    no dot in the domain, and refusing that would lock a whole tenant out of its
    own workspace over a cosmetic rule. A control character is a different

def looks_like_email(value: str) -> bool:

    Shape only — never deliverability, and never a claim the mailbox exists.
    Callers raise their own error (a 422 in the API layer, a ``ValueError`` in
    a pydantic validator) so the message can stay appropriate to the surface;
    the recipient-list validator in particular must not echo the offending
    value, which is third-party PII on an HTTP error body.

    Composed over :func:`is_header_safe` because the shape pattern's character
    classes are built on ``\s``, which excludes only whitespace — so NUL, ESC,
    DEL and the rest of the C0 range passed the shape rule while the
    header-safety rule refused them. That gap reached three surfaces that do
    not additionally call ``is_header_safe``: the signup admin address
    (`api/signup`), a partner-provisioned child tenant's admin login
    (`api/partner`), and the scheduled-report recipient list
    (`schemas/scheduled_report`, whose ``strip()`` removes whitespace only) —
    each a value that becomes both a login and a mail destination. CR and LF
    were already refused, so §50's header-injection fix was never affected;
    this closes the wider class §60 introduced ``is_header_safe`` for.
    Ordering it first also keeps the stricter rule strictly stronger than the
    weaker one, which is the property the two guards assume.
