    # A GL code must resolve to exactly ONE account in any chart that uses it —
    # two rows answering to one code makes "which account was this invoice
    # coded to?" unanswerable, and `gl_recode._ActiveChart` / the extraction
    # catalog both treat a code as a set member, so the second row is invisible
    # right up until someone reconciles the GL.
    #
    # It takes TWO partial indexes, not one `UNIQUE (organization_id,
    # entity_id, code)`, because `entity_id` NULL is *meaningful* here (the
    # SHARED chart — unlike every other business table, where NULL is an
    # unstamped legacy row) and NULLs never compare equal in a unique index:
    # a plain 3-column unique would let the shared chart hold "6000" any
    # number of times, which is precisely the duplicate this exists to stop.
    #
    #   * shared rows  → unique on (organization_id, code) WHERE entity_id IS NULL
    #   * entity rows  → unique on (organization_id, entity_id, code) WHERE NOT NULL
    #
    # A shared "6000" and an entity's own "6000" therefore coexist by design —
    # that is an entity OVERRIDING the shared account, and the effective chart
    # `shared ∪ own` still resolves it to one row per entity because
    # `api/gl_accounts._sync_match_query` prefers the entity's own.
    # Migration 0088 installs both on existing tenants.
