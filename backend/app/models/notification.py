"""Notification model — in-app notification center rows (tenant-scoped).

One row per (recipient, event). Lives in the tenant DB alongside invoices so
the notification center query is tenant-isolated through `get_tenant_db()`.
`recipient_user_id` references a control-plane `users.id` but carries no FK —
the User lives in a different database, so the link is by value only.

Notification *preferences* are user-global and live on the control-plane
`User.notification_prefs` JSONB column, not here.
