"""Outbound webhook subscriptions + delivery log — control-plane.

A ``WebhookSubscription`` lets an org's external integrator subscribe to
platform events (invoice approved, payment settled, exception raised) at a
target URL. Each emitted event becomes a ``WebhookDelivery`` row per matching
active subscription; the dispatch service signs the payload (HMAC-SHA256) and
POSTs it with bounded retries, dead-lettering after exhaustion.

Both tables live in the CONTROL plane keyed by ``organization_id`` — the SAME
placement as the programmatic ``ApiKey`` (see ``app/models/api_key.py``): an
outbound webhook is the push counterpart of the pull ``/api/v1`` surface, and a
subscription belongs to an org, not a tenant DB. Added to
``tenant_provisioning.CONTROL_TABLES`` so it never fans out to per-tenant DBs.

Signing-secret hashing rationale (read before "fixing" this):
    The signing secret is the customer's verification key — they must be able to
    re-derive the same HMAC we send, so unlike a password it is a SHARED secret
    that the dispatch service needs in plaintext at send time. It is generated
    server-side (``secrets.token_urlsafe``), returned to the admin EXACTLY ONCE
    at create time (like an API-key mint), and stored as a plaintext column so
    the dispatcher can sign with it. It is NEVER logged or echoed back after
    creation (list/get responses carry only ``secret_prefix``). This is the same
    trade-off the per-tenant inbound webhook secrets make
    (``Organization.settings.payments.webhook_secret`` is stored verbatim too) —
    an HMAC verification key is symmetric by definition.
