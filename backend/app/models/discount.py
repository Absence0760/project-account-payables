"""Dynamic discounting — supplier-offered early-payment discount offers.

A :class:`DiscountOffer` is a *dynamic*, time-boxed early-payment proposal:
"pay within N days for X% off", optionally as a sliding scale of tiers
(5 days → 3%, 10 days → 2%, 15 days → 1%). Offers are scoped either to a
single invoice or to a vendor (a bulk "pay all open invoices from Vendor X
early for 2%" negotiation).

This is distinct from ``PaymentSchedule.discount_percent`` — that is the
*static* term captured at invoice creation ("2/10 net 30"). A
``DiscountOffer`` is negotiable, has its own accept / decline / expire
lifecycle, and is optimized against cash on hand (see
``services/discount_optimizer.py``) and auto-captured when its annualized
ROI clears the org threshold (see ``services/discount_auto_trigger.py``).

Money is ``Numeric`` and tier percents are stored as Decimal-strings inside
the ``tiers`` JSONB to preserve exactness (never float). See
``backend/docs/dynamic-discounting.md``.
