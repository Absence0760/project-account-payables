# teardown therefore acknowledges a write before making it durable, and a fast

# `control_engine` and `_tenant_engines` belong to the event loop that first
# drives them — in a running app, the one uvicorn owns. An asyncpg connection
# is bound to its loop, so using one of these from a SECOND loop does not
# merely fail: it raises `RuntimeError: got Future attached to a different
# loop` AND can hand the half-used connection back to the pool the request
# path draws from, after which unrelated requests hang on it. That is not
# hypothetical — it took nine e2e specs red via `payment_erp_sync`, presenting
# as `PATCH /api/organization` timing out (see docs/known-issues.md).
#
# `extraction_dispatch` genuinely needs its own loop in a worker thread: it
# runs PyMuPDF rendering and Tesseract OSD, which are synchronous CPU work that
# would stall the request loop. So the fix cannot be "never use another loop" —
# it has to be "a foreign loop never touches these engines".
#
# The chokepoint is here rather than at the ~70 call sites, because the danger
# is *reaching for a global*, and a new call site would reintroduce it. A
# dispatcher declares its own loop-local engines once via
# `dispatch_engine_scope`; every `control_session_factory()` /
# `get_tenant_engine()` beneath it — including the ones inside
# `notification_dispatch`, `audit_dispatch` and `webhooks.dispatch` that it
# never calls directly — transparently uses those instead.
#
# A ContextVar is the right carrier: a new thread starts with an EMPTY context,
# so a worker can never leak its engines into the request path, and
# `asyncio.create_task` copies the context, so nested work inherits them.
