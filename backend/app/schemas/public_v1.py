"""Stable serialization shapes for the public ``/api/v1`` surface.

These are the *external contract* for programmatic integrators — deliberately
decoupled from the internal ORM models so an internal column rename or addition
never silently changes the v1 response. Adding a field to the internal model
does NOT add it here; it must be added explicitly. Money is serialised as a
string-Decimal so exactness survives JSON (never float).
