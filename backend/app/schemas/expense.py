"""Pydantic request/response schemas for the expenses + expense-reports routers.

Money convention (mirrors ``schemas/contract.py``): request fields are typed
``Decimal | None`` for exactness on the way in; response/list fields serialise
money as ``float | None`` (the router does ``float(...)``). Never ``float`` on a
column or in-memory total.

Every request-side ``Decimal`` is digit-bounded to the ``Numeric(precision,
scale)`` of the column it lands in, via ``max_digits`` / ``decimal_places`` on
its ``Field``. Unbounded, an over-range amount passed validation and blew up at
the DB flush as an unhandled ``DataError`` — a 500 where the caller's own bad
input deserves a 422. ``tests/test_schema_decimal_bounds.py`` is the guard that
keeps a newly added field from re-opening the hole.

Policy / pre-approval / card-transaction schemas are defined here too so the
later workflows (WF2-4) can reuse them — only the expenses + expense-reports
endpoints are wired in WF1.

    ever a *label* until something groups or compares on it:

    * ``""`` is silently read as the target currency by
      ``expense_currency.normalize_currency(code, default=...)`` — so a blank
      code became "whatever this report/threshold is in", the quiet
      assume-the-default that locked-FX exists to eliminate;
    * ``"usd"`` and ``"USD"`` are two ``GROUP BY`` keys, so
      ``GET /api/expenses/summary`` emitted two ``by_currency`` buckets both
      labelled ``USD`` after the response uppercased them; and
    * the card-reconciliation candidate query compares
      ``Expense.currency == txn.currency`` in SQL, while the card CSV importer
      already uppercases — so a lowercase expense was invisible to the
      suggestions for a transaction it exactly matched.

    Normalising at the boundary fixes all three at the source and keeps what is
