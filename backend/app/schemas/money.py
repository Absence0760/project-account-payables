"""Money-typed annotations for request and response schemas.

The DB stores money as ``Numeric(15, 2)`` and the workflow / payment
code uses ``Decimal`` throughout, but response schemas used to retype
those values to ``float`` at the API boundary, which collapses any
amount beyond ~$9 quadrillion and reintroduces float rounding for
totals built from many small line items.

These annotations keep the in-Python value as ``Decimal`` (the
``money is exact`` project invariant) while serialising to a JSON
number — that's what the frontend types expect (``amount: number``)
and what current Storybook / API consumers parse. The conversion
happens once, at JSON-write time.

For JavaScript clients that need *exact* arithmetic on these values,
switch to ``Decimal | None`` with Pydantic's default string
serialisation. JS ``Number`` is fine for display + comparison up to
roughly 2**53 cents (~$90 trillion); accounts-payable amounts sit
comfortably below that.

def parse_exact_money(value: object) -> object:
    """Parse an INBOUND money value without ever routing it through ``float``.

    ``json.loads`` decodes the request body — or an LLM tool-call's arguments —
    before any pydantic validator runs, so a JSON *number* carrying a
    fractional part is already a Python ``float`` by the time this sees it: the
    rounding has happened and nothing downstream can undo it. Typing the field
    ``Decimal`` does not help. Pydantic returns ``Decimal('100')`` for a body
    containing ``100.00000000000000001``, because that literal was a float long
    before pydantic was involved.

    Only the **string** form round-trips exactly, so that is the shape a
    fractional amount must arrive in. A JSON integer is admitted as well —
    ``json.loads`` yields a Python ``int`` for it, which is exact, and it is the
    shape existing callers already send. A ``float`` is refused with a message
    naming the fix, rather than silently accepted at whatever value the double
    happened to round to.

    Two places this is load-bearing, both of which decide where money goes
    rather than how it is displayed (root ``CLAUDE.md`` § Project invariants):

    * ``discount.OptimizerRequest.cash_budget`` — the budget
      ``discount_optimizer.optimize`` selects against, i.e. which invoices get
      paid early.
    * the cash-flow copilot's plan parameters — ``compute_plan_id`` hashes
      ``str()`` of each of them, and ``POST /plans/{plan_id}/draft-run`` stages
      a real ``PaymentRun`` from the plan that id certifies. A rounded figure
      there is both a different selection AND an id asserting the rounded
      figure is what the plan was built from.

    Because the preimage is built from ``str()``, this deliberately performs no
    normalisation: ``"8.00"`` stays ``Decimal("8.00")`` and does not become
    ``Decimal("8")``. Rescaling here would change the hash of a plan whose
    parameters had not changed — see
    ``tests/test_cash_flow_plan_lifecycle.py::test_the_decimal_scale_is_part_of_the_preimage``.
