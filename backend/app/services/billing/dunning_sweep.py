"""Dunning / past-due automation sweep — control-plane subscriptions.

The provider's own retry schedule (Stripe Smart Retries) normally drives a
failing subscription ``active → past_due → canceled`` and we learn about each
hop via the inbound billing webhook (``api/billing_webhook.py``). This sweep is
the **backstop** for when a terminal provider webhook never arrives: a
subscription that has sat ``past_due`` longer than the grace window
(``FEOH_BILLING_DUNNING_GRACE_DAYS``) is flagged ``canceled`` with an append-only
audit row.

Money-path boundary (important)
-------------------------------
This sweep ONLY changes a ``Subscription`` lifecycle status (``past_due`` →
``canceled``). It never charges a card, never refunds, never creates any
payment-side row — it can't move money. Down-grading entitlements is a
consequence read by ``get_entitlements`` (a canceled subscription grants
nothing), not a money operation.

Control-plane only
------------------
Unlike the tenant-fan-out sweeps (``contract_renewal`` / ``recurring_invoices``),
``Subscription`` lives in the control DB keyed by org, so this sweep runs one
query against the control plane — no per-tenant engine churn.

Idempotency
-----------
Only ``past_due`` rows are touched, and canceling one moves it out of
``past_due``; a re-run never re-cancels (the status guard is the dedupe). Each
row is re-read ``FOR UPDATE`` inside its own leg and re-checked, so a webhook
canceling concurrently can't be double-applied either.

Per-row isolation, and why the audit row gates the commit
---------------------------------------------------------
This module used to claim "one row's failure logged but never halts the sweep"
while having no per-row guard at all: a raise on ``control_db.commit()`` (or
anywhere in the loop) aborted every remaining ``past_due`` row for the tick, and
because a rollback expires the already-loaded ORM objects, touching the next one
raised ``MissingGreenlet`` rather than a clean failure. It also returned a bare
``int``, which ``sweep_health.extract_counts`` maps to ``{"count": n}`` — no
``failures`` key, so ``failure_count`` summed to zero and this sweep could never
report anything but ``ok`` short of the tick itself raising. Both are fixed the
way ``vendor_rescreen`` fixed them: ids are selected first, each row is handled
in its own try / rollback, and the tick returns a :class:`DunningResult` whose
``failures`` field the health registry reads.

The audit row is also no longer best-effort. ``dispatch_auth_audit`` swallows
every exception by design (an audit blip must never fail a login), so the sweep
could commit a cancellation whose ``billing.subscription_canceled`` row was
never written and still count it a success — a status change on a regulated
record with nothing in the trail. :func:`_record_cancellation_audit` writes the
same row through ``dispatch_audit``, which does NOT swallow, so a failed audit
write rolls the cancellation back and counts a failure; the next tick retries
it. The audit row is committed first, so a crash between the two leaves an audit
row for a cancellation that then re-runs — a duplicate trail entry, which is
recoverable, rather than a silent one, which is not.

Mirrors the other sweeps: long-lived asyncio task started in ``main.lifespan``,
one row's failure logged but never halts the sweep. Disabled by default
(``FEOH_BILLING_DUNNING_ENABLED``). See ``backend/docs/billing.md``.
