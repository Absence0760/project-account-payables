"""AWS Lambda handler for audit logging.

Triggered by SQS messages when audit_mode = "lambda".
Each message contains { correlation_id, organization_id, actor_id, action,
                        entity_type, entity_id, details }.

The producer (``services/audit_dispatch``) also puts a ``tenant_db_name`` on the
body. **This handler ignores it.** The database a tenant's audit row lands in is
re-derived here from ``organization_id`` against the control plane, the same way
``extraction_lambda`` and ``erp_lambda`` do — so the one input that chooses a
database is a column on a resolved ``Organization`` row, never a string off the
queue. That is the project's tenant-isolation invariant stated at the point of
use rather than at the point of publish, and it also means a hostile or stale
``tenant_db_name`` cannot steer the connection at all. The field stays on the
wire for compatibility with in-flight messages during a deploy; nothing reads it.

Deploy this module as the Lambda handler: app.services.audit_lambda.handler
