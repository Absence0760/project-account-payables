"""Dynamic-discounting auto-capture sweep — auto-accept worthwhile open offers.

Every tick:

  1. Enumerate tenant DBs from the control plane.
  2. For each tenant, find ``offered`` :class:`~app.models.discount.DiscountOffer`
     rows that are still valid (not past ``valid_until``).
  3. For each, pick the best tier (highest discount percent) and compute its
     annualized ROI via :func:`app.services.discount_roi.compute_roi`, using the
     org's cost of capital
     (``Organization.settings.discounting.cost_of_capital_pct`` →
     ``settings.discount_cost_of_capital_pct`` fallback).
  4. If the annualized return clears ``settings.discount_auto_capture_roi_threshold``
     **and** the ROI is ``worthwhile``, AUTO-ACCEPT the offer: stamp
     ``accepted_tier`` / ``accepted_at`` and move ``status`` → ``accepted``, then
     write an append-only ``discount_offer.auto_accepted`` audit row.

Money-path boundary (important)
-------------------------------
This sweep ONLY accepts an offer — it flags it for capture by transitioning
``offered`` → ``accepted``. It deliberately does **not** execute a payment or
create any ``Payment`` / ``PaymentRun`` row. Actually moving the money still
flows through the normal CFO-gated payment-run path, exactly like a manually
accepted offer. Keeping the auto-trigger payment-free is what prevents it from
silently moving money: the worst it can do is mark a high-ROI discount as
"accepted", which a human still has to fund.

Idempotency
-----------
Only ``offered`` offers are touched, and accepting one moves it out of
``offered``. So a re-run never double-accepts — the status guard is the dedupe
(the same role ``renewal_alert_sent_at`` plays in ``contract_renewal``).

Mirrors the ``contract_renewal`` pattern: long-lived asyncio task started in
``main.lifespan``, fresh per-tenant engine, one tenant's failure logged but
never halts the sweep. Within a tenant it mirrors ``vendor_rescreen``: each
offer is re-read by id, guarded, and committed **on its own**, so one offer that
raises can't abort the tick and discard the acceptances already made on it — see
:func:`_sweep_tenant` and ``backend/docs/background-sweeps.md`` § Locking.
Disabled by default (``FEOH_DISCOUNT_OPTIMIZATION_ENABLED``).
See ``backend/docs/dynamic-discounting.md``.
