"""Sync payment data to the connected ERP after payment execution.

Runs async in a background thread — doesn't block the payment run response.
Records sync status on each payment for retry capability.

**This module is the only code path that flips an invoice
``payment_scheduled → paid``**, and it is invoked exactly twice, both
fire-and-forget after a terminal event: at the end of ``POST
/api/payments/runs/{id}/execute`` and from the payment webhook once a payment
settles. Nothing re-invokes it for a payment that is already ``completed`` —
the reconciler backstop only re-dispatches payments it moves OUT of
``submitted``/``processing``. Two consequences shape the design here:

**A failed leg is a strand, so it must be visible.** If a payment's leg raises,
the money has already moved but the invoice stays ``payment_scheduled``
forever: the ERP is never told, and the invoice's aging and 1099 YTD totals are
wrong. That used to be a ``logger.warning`` carrying an exception class name and
a counter that died with the thread — no exception row, no notification, no
persisted marker, nothing to act on. Every failed leg now opens a de-duped,
PII-free ``erp_reconciliation`` exception naming the payment, the run, and the
retry endpoint, so the strand lands in the queue an AP manager already works.
(``erp_reconciliation`` is the type ``api/erp_webhook`` already raises for "the
ERP and our ledger disagree and a human must reconcile" — the same situation.)

**A failed leg must not take its siblings down.** The loop used to run every
payment inside one transaction and commit once at the end. A leg that failed
with a DB error poisoned that transaction, so the final commit raised, the
outer handler rolled back, and the run's *successful* transitions were
discarded too — silently, with nothing to re-invoke them. Each leg now re-reads
its own rows by id and commits on its own, so an earlier success can never be
undone by a later failure and no leg is left holding ORM state expired by
another leg's rollback.

The exit for a strand is ``POST /api/payments/runs/{run_id}/sync-erp``, which
awaits this same pass and returns its counts. Voiding is NOT an exit here — the
money moved, and ``/void`` sends the invoice back to ``approved`` where it
invites a second payment. That asymmetry is why the retry endpoint exists;
contrast the ``held`` (short-settlement) path, which is a deliberate hold with
its own two documented exits (accept / void).
