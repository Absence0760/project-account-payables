"""Notification dispatch — fan an invoice lifecycle event out to recipients.

Two effects per recipient, each gated by that recipient's per-user preference:

1. **in-app** — insert a `Notification` row into the *tenant* DB (the same
   session that owns the status transition, so it commits atomically with it).
2. **email** — build an `EmailMessage` and hand it to the configured email
   adapter (`console` by default — safe, no network, no secrets). This leg, and
   the chat post below it, run **after the caller commits** (see below).

**The outbound legs run POST-COMMIT.** Everything that talks to a third party —
every email, and the single Slack/Teams post — is queued onto the caller's
session via `services/post_commit.enqueue_post_commit` and fired from
SQLAlchemy's `after_commit`. Before this, `transition_invoice` awaited the whole
fan-out *inside* the caller's still-open transaction: `payment_erp_sync` holds
`SELECT … FOR UPDATE` on the invoice and `review.approve_invoice` on the
`WorkflowInstance` until after the transition returns, so a hung chat webhook
held a row lock on a live invoice for its full 10-second timeout and N
recipients multiplied the email leg linearly. Nothing else about the contract
moved: the in-app `Notification` rows are still added to the caller's session
and still ride its commit, because those are DB writes and *should*. A
transaction that rolls back sends nothing, which is the correct semantics — we
no longer email people about a status change that never happened.

Both are **best-effort**. A failure here must never roll back or abort the
caller's status transition / audit write, so the whole dispatch is wrapped in a
guard and logs without PII (event type + notification id only, never the
recipient's email address or any invoice banking field).

**The two OUTBOUND send guards log the exception's class name, not
``logger.exception``.** `.exception()` / `exc_info=True` append the traceback —
and with it the exception's own text — no matter what the format string says,
and both transports raise errors that carry exactly what this module promises
not to log: httpx's ``HTTPStatusError`` embeds the request URL, which for a
Slack/Teams incoming webhook IS the credential, and ``SMTPRecipientsRefused``
embeds the addresses it refused. The remaining ``logger.exception`` calls here
wrap DB reads and template renders, whose exceptions carry row ids and SQL
rather than a credential or an address — there the traceback is the diagnostic
value, so it stays.

    """Post one approval event to the org's chat channel (Slack/Teams).

    ``invoice_id`` is the invoice PK, deliberately NOT named ``entity_id``:
    everywhere else in this codebase ``entity_id`` is the multi-entity
    subsidiary FK, so the old name read as a tenant-scoping bug on every review
    of this file. The caller narrows its generic ``entity_id`` to an invoice id
    before calling (the chat fan-out only fires for ``entity_type=="invoice"``).

    Best-effort + fully self-guarded: any failure (config load, adapter build,
    transport) is swallowed and logged PII-free so the caller's transaction is
    never affected. No-ops when the org hasn't enabled chat, the event isn't a
    chat-notifiable approval event, or the provider can't be resolved.

    For the "assigned for review" event, when the org's chat provider has an
    interactive approval surface (Slack or Teams) and the action-signing key is
    configured, the message gets Approve/Reject actions. Each carries a signed,
    single-use action token bound to the intended approver (the assigned
    reviewer) on that provider's own channel — the same primitive the
    email-approval link uses. The adapter has the final say on rendering: Teams
    also needs its interactivity secret, without which it emits a read-only card.
