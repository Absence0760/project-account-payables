    This is the ONLY path that pushes an invoice to an ERP —

    here. It used to be a single `try/except` that sent a transient 503 or
    timeout straight to `InvoiceStatus.failed`, while a second, unreachable
    copy of this function carried the 3-attempt exponential backoff that the
    tests, `retry_erp`'s counter reset, and the docs all describe. The retry
    semantics were tested but not shipped, and the divergence was invisible
    precisely because nothing in production reached the copy that had them.

    Retrying is safe to do here rather than only by hand: `_call_erp` sends the
    invoice's `correlation_id` as the adapter's idempotency key, so a retry
    after a timeout that the ERP actually applied returns the existing
    document rather than posting a second one.

    The transaction is closed before each sleep, so the wait does not hold a
    pooled connection open — `erp_dispatch` builds a `pool_size=1` engine per
    send, and sleeping with the connection checked out would pin a worker slot
    for the whole backoff instead of just the call.
