"""Settlement-amount verification — did the processor move what we authorized?

The processor's webhook is the settlement moment for every real rail: ACH,
wire, SEPA and cheque all sit ``submitted``/``processing`` until the provider
calls back, and that callback is what stamps the regulated ``completed_at``.
Until now the handler took the provider's word for the *status* and never
looked at the *amount* — a webhook saying "settled" flipped the payment to
``completed``, captured any accepted early-pay discount and told the ERP the
invoice was paid, without one comparison against the figure AP actually
authorized.

That is the same hole the other two reconcilers already close, one and two
steps further downstream:

* ``positive_pay.classify_presented_items`` — a cheque found by number whose
  presented amount differs beyond a cent is ``amount_mismatch`` (an ALTERED
  cheque), never ``matched_ok``.
* ``bank_reconciliation.classify_discrepancy`` — a bank line matched on our
  own trace reference whose amount differs is ``amount_mismatch``, linked but
  excluded from ``matched_count``.

Identity is not reconciliation. A ``provider_payment_id`` proves *which*
payment the event is about; it does not prove the processor moved the amount
on the instruction. This module supplies the missing comparison at the
earliest, most authoritative point — days before a bank statement is uploaded,
and for rails (ACH, SEPA, wire) where no cheque ever exists to present.

Pure: no DB, no clock, no I/O. ``app/api/payments.py::payment_webhook`` owns
what to *do* with a discrepancy (audit row + a payment-blocking ``fraud_flag``
exception + suppressing the discount capture); this module only decides
whether there is one.

Two legs are authorized, not one. A cross-currency payment debits
``Payment.source_amount`` in the org's home currency and credits
``Payment.amount`` in the invoice's currency (see
``services/international_payments.prepare_international_payment``), and
different processors report different sides of that. Reporting *either*
authorized leg is a match; reporting a third number is not.

    rather than the transient state of an exception a human is expected to

    the correct response to an over-settlement — stranded the invoice
    permanently, because nothing re-invokes the sweep that would then have
    marked it paid.

    States:

    ``covered``
        Some authorized leg is fully covered by what settled, **or** nothing
        was ever reported. Fails OPEN on the absent case on purpose: NULL
        means an amount-free rail (Dwolla's bare envelope) or a row predating
        migration 0083, and treating "we don't know" as a shortfall would hold
        every invoice those rails settle. Absence is not evidence — the same
        posture ``verify_settlement`` takes with ``unverified``.

    ``short``
        A figure was reported and it falls below EVERY currency-compatible
        authorized leg by more than ``tolerance``. The vendor is short; the
        invoice must not read as settled in full.

    ``uncertain``
        A figure was reported that we cannot evaluate. Two ways in: it came in
        a currency matching no authorized leg (comparing across currencies
        without a rate would be inventing an answer), or it did not fit
        ``payments.settled_amount`` at all and only the
        ``settled_amount_unstorable`` flag survives (migration 0085). Either
        way it holds like a shortfall and a human reconciles.

        The unstorable case is checked FIRST and deliberately does not fall
        through to the NULL branch below: ``settled_amount`` is NULL in both,
        but NULL alone means "nothing was ever reported" and fails OPEN. A
        garbage report is not an absent one, and must not be laundered into
        "nothing contradicts this invoice being settled".

    Over-settlement is ``covered``: the vendor received at least what was
    authorized, so the invoice is discharged. It is still flagged by
    ``verify_settlement`` as an ``amount_mismatch`` — recording that too much
    moved is a separate concern from whether the payable is satisfied.
