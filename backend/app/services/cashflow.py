"""Cash-position helpers — bank-balance auto-sync + persisted alert thresholds.

Three pieces backing the cash-position dashboard (`GET /api/analytics/cash_position`
and the threshold GET/PUT) and the cash-flow copilot, kept out of
`api/analytics.py` so the route file stays SQL-and-shaping only:

1. ``fetch_provider_balance`` — best-effort read of the org's funding-account
   balance from its configured payment adapter's optional ``get_balance``
   capability. Lets the CFO skip typing an opening balance by hand. Falls back
   (returns ``None``) when no provider supports it or the fetch fails — it NEVER
   raises, so a bank-link outage can't 500 the dashboard. The local-first `mock`
   adapter returns a deterministic figure, so `pnpm dev` needs no real bank
   credential.

2. ``resolve_opening_balance`` — the whole resolution CHAIN (explicit → provider
   auto-sync → persisted settings → zero) plus its provenance, in one place so
   every consumer resolves the same number the same way and can say where it
   came from.

3. ``resolve_cash_thresholds`` / ``store_cash_thresholds`` — read/normalise the
   per-org alert thresholds persisted on ``Organization.settings.cashflow``
   (JSON — no migration). The cash-position endpoint reads the persisted
   ``min_balance_threshold`` when the request doesn't override it.

Money is `Decimal` end-to-end; nothing here logs an account number (the adapter
returns only an opaque ``account_ref`` label, never a full PAN/account number).
