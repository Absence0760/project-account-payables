"""Base chat-notification adapter interface and shared types.

A chat-notification adapter posts an approval-lifecycle event (invoice
assigned / approved / rejected / paid) to a team chat channel via that
provider's *incoming webhook* (Slack / Microsoft Teams). It is a fan-out
sink, never a money path.

The payload is deliberately **PII-free** — only invoice number, vendor name,
amount + currency, status, and an optional deep link. Never bank details, tax
IDs, full addresses, or payment-method numbers (these strings land in a chat
channel and provider logs). The renderer is the single place that decides what
text a message may carry; adapters only shape it into the provider's JSON body.
