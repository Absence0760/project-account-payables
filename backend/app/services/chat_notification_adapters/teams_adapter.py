"""Microsoft Teams chat-notification adapter — posts to an incoming-webhook URL.

Teams incoming webhooks accept a legacy **MessageCard** JSON body — a different
shape from Slack's ``{text, blocks}``. We send a MessageCard with a summary, a
title, a ``facts`` section (vendor / status / amount), an optional
``potentialAction`` "OpenUri" button for the deep link, and — on the
"assigned for review" event, when the approval feature is fully configured —
**Approve / Reject ``HttpPOST`` actions** that close the loop back to
``POST /api/approvals/teams/interactivity``.

Same fail-closed contract as the Slack adapter: the per-org
``Organization.settings.chat_notifications.webhook_url`` is the credential, so an
absent URL is a no-op + PII-free warning, never an exception. No platform-level
hardcoded fallback.

**Why the action carries its own signature.** A MessageCard ``HttpPOST`` action
is dispatched by Microsoft, not by us, so there is no shared-secret handshake to
piggyback on the way a Teams *Outgoing Webhook* has one. What we do control is
the action's exact ``body`` string and its ``headers``, so the card is stamped at
render time with ``HMAC-SHA256(security token, body)`` over that exact string —
the same digest, from the same :mod:`app.services.teams_signature` primitive, that
the endpoint re-derives. That digest proves the POST replays a body **we** minted;
it is not a key and cannot sign a different body. Anyone who could extract it
could only re-fire this one action, which the single-use ``jti`` already collapses
to a no-op — the same exposure as the Slack buttons, where any channel member can
click. Authorization still rides entirely on the signed, per-approver, single-use
action token inside the body.

No signature (no ``FEOH_TEAMS_SECURITY_TOKEN``) → **no actions are rendered**.
A button whose POST the endpoint is guaranteed to reject is worse than no button:
the approver clicks it and is told nothing happened.
