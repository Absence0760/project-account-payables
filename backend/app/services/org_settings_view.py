"""What `GET /api/organization` may serve out of `Organization.settings`.

That endpoint is gated only by `get_current_user` — no role check — and returned
the raw settings JSONB, so **every** authenticated role, `ap_clerk` included,
could read the tenant's third-party credentials: `erp.client_secret` /
`erp.api_key` / `erp.webhook_signing_secret`, `payments.credentials` +
`payments.webhook_secret`, `cards.api_key` + `cards.webhook_signing_secret`,
`extraction.api_key`, `sso.client_secret` + `sso.scim_bearer_hash`, and
`chat_notifications.webhook_url`. Any one of those is enough to act as the
tenant against a third party; the chat webhook URL alone lets its holder post
into the channel where payments are approved.

Two rules, and they answer different questions:

**`NON_ADMIN_SETTINGS` — an allow-list, not a deny-list.** A deny-list of
secret-looking key names is the wrong shape for a free-form JSONB blob that
keeps growing: the day someone adds a provider block, the leak is the default.
Here, exposure requires a deliberate edit to this file, and each entry has to
name a real non-admin consumer.

**`ALWAYS_REDACTED` — dropped for every role, admin included.** One value is
write-only by design rather than by privilege: the chat incoming-webhook URL is
a bearer capability whose only management path is the audited
`/api/organization/chat-notifications/webhook`. Leaving it readable here would
make "no endpoint ever returns it" false and give the settings page a silent,
unaudited second way to see it.

Admins otherwise still get the settings **verbatim** — the `/organization` page
reads saved credentials back into its form fields, so redacting for them would
blank a live config on the next save. Narrowing what an admin sees needs a
"leave blank to keep" contract on the write path; that is a separate change.

Pure: no DB, no request, no I/O.
