"""Background shipper for centralized, WORM-compliant audit-log storage.

Every tick:

  1. Enumerate tenant DBs from the control plane.
  2. For each tenant, SELECT up to `FEOH_AUDIT_SHIPPING_BATCH_SIZE`
     `audit_log` rows with `shipped_at IS NULL`, oldest first.
  3. Fan the batch out to every configured adapter (CloudWatch, S3, …).
     All adapters must succeed before we mark the rows shipped.
  4. On success, stamp `shipped_at = now()` in a single UPDATE.
  5. On failure, isolate a poison row (see below), then leave whatever is
     still unshipped at `shipped_at` NULL so the next tick retries, and log
     a WARNING with the tenant + row count.

Poison rows must not stop the trail
-----------------------------------
The batch is all-or-nothing and ordered `created_at ASC`, so ONE row a sink
refuses — audit `details` is free-form JSONB, and a sink can reject a payload
for its shape, an encoding, or a size the adapter cannot shrink — used to make
`adapter.ship` raise on every tick, re-select the identical oldest-first batch,
and stop every NEWER row for that tenant from ever shipping. The WORM evidence
trail simply ended there, and the only remedy was an operator noticing the
`degraded` sweep and editing (or trimming) the offending row by hand.

So a failed batch is followed by a bounded isolation pass: the rows are shipped
one at a time, in order, and a row an adapter refuses is re-offered to THAT
adapter with its `details` replaced by a PII-free quarantine marker
(`_details_quarantined`, the row's identity + the refusing exception's class,
never the refused payload). If the marker version ships, the row is stamped and
the pass moves on — the trail keeps moving and the complete row is still in the
tenant `audit_log` table. If even the marker version is refused, the sink itself
is unhealthy rather than the row: the pass stops there, everything from that row
on stays unshipped, and the tick is a failure exactly as before. That is what
bounds an outage to two extra calls per adapter instead of one per row, and what
stops a transient outage from quarantining a whole batch's details.

Rows the isolation pass re-ships were already offered inside the failed batch,
so a sink may see them twice. That is the same at-least-once seam
`audit_shipping/base.py` documents: every event carries the `audit_log` row's
own `id`, so a duplicate is identifiable on read, and a duplicated audit row is
recoverable where a missing one is not.

SOC 2 control — the `audit_log` table is per-tenant and lives inside the
customer's tenant DB, where a determined admin could theoretically edit
rows. Shipping them out to CloudWatch Logs (append-only) and S3 Object
Lock (immutable for the retention period) gives auditors an independent
tamper-evident copy.

Mirrors the `extraction_reaper` pattern: long-lived asyncio task started
in `main.lifespan`, per-tenant fresh engine, tenant failures logged but
don't halt the sweep. No thread pool — SQLAlchemy async + `asyncio.to_thread`
for the boto3 calls is all the concurrency we need.
