"""Retrieval-Augmented Generation for invoice extraction.

Three entry points:

  - extract_invoice_text(file_bytes) — PyMuPDF text extraction for embedding.
  - store_embedding(db, invoice, file_bytes) — embed + upsert at correction time.
  - retrieve_similar(db, query_text, k) — cosine-nearest search for few-shot context.
