"""Expense policy engine — pure, deterministic, no LLM, no DB, no network.

Given an ``Expense`` (or a report's expenses) and the set of active
``ExpensePolicy`` rows, derive the list of policy violations. The engine itself
does **no** I/O: the caller (``api/expenses.py`` / the report-submit route)
loads the active policies (and any approved pre-approvals) from the tenant DB
and hands them in, so this module stays trivially unit-testable.

Money is ``Decimal`` throughout — never ``float``. Mileage reimbursement,
per-diem caps, and category limits all compare ``Decimal`` to ``Decimal``.

A violation is a small JSON-serialisable dict::

    {"code": "category_limit", "message": "...", "policy_id": "<uuid>",
     "limit": "100.00", "actual": "150.00"}

``code`` is one of the module-level ``VIOLATION_*`` constants. ``BLOCKING_CODES``
names the subset that blocks report submission (missing required receipt, or a
required pre-approval that is absent / not approved). Everything else is
advisory and surfaces as a warning badge.

Every comparison is **currency-aware**. A policy's money thresholds
(``category_limit`` / ``per_diem_amount`` / ``requires_receipt_above`` /
``requires_preapproval_above`` / ``mileage_rate``) are denominated in the policy's
``threshold_currency``, and the expense is expressed in that currency before
being compared — a €200 EUR expense is never judged against a USD 100 limit as
bare numbers. ``threshold_currency`` is ``NULL`` on rows that predate the
column; the caller then supplies the org's **reporting currency** as
``default_threshold_currency`` (that is the unit the whole app already assumes
for a bare number — the CFO expense threshold, the policy table in the UI).

No FX call happens here: this engine is pure. The expense is expressed in the
threshold currency using only what a write path already locked
(``expense_currency.expense_amount_in_currency``). When that yields ``None`` —
a foreign-currency expense with no lock into the threshold currency — the
comparison genuinely **cannot** be made, and every rule then **fails closed**:
the violation is raised anyway, tagged ``comparison: "unresolved"``. A blocking
rule therefore demands the receipt / pre-approval instead of waving the expense
through on a comparison that was never performed.

    than waived on a comparison that never happened, and the advisory limits flag
    for a human instead of silently passing. The one thing that still clears a
    blocking rule is evidence that does not depend on the rate — an attached
