# Line-total reconciliation
#
# `Invoice.amount` is the number a payment run pays. `InvoiceLineItem.total` is
# what the reviewer edits in the invoice modal. Nothing used to tie the two
# together, so correcting a line left the header at its old value: the payment
# paid the stale header, PO-match variance had been computed against a total the
# lines no longer supported, and no trace of the divergence existed anywhere.
#
# We deliberately do NOT recompute `amount` from the lines. Line `total`
# semantics are not uniform across the ingest paths — the vision-adapter prompt
# and the mock adapter emit a TAX-INCLUSIVE line total, while `e_invoice.mapper`
# maps the same column onto UBL `LineExtensionAmount`, which is tax-EXCLUSIVE —
# and lines are frequently partial (a reviewer keys in only the disputed line).
# Silently overwriting the header from a sum under either misreading would move
# money with no approval behind it, which is exactly what the post-approval
# financial freeze exists to prevent. Nor do we hard-reject a mismatch: header
# `tax_amount` / `shipping_amount` / `discount_amount` are separate columns, so
# `sum(lines) != amount` is the normal shape of a perfectly valid invoice.
#
# Instead we reconcile explicitly and make any genuine divergence loud: a sum is
# accepted when it matches EITHER standard convention, and anything else raises
# an `error`-severity warning plus a de-duped `line_total_mismatch` exception
# into the queue, so the invoice cannot reach approval without a human seeing
# that its header and its lines disagree.
