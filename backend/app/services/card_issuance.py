Used by both the explicit `/api/cards/generate` endpoint and the

    Card issuance mints a real, spendable card, so it needs the same
    idempotency discipline as a payment (project invariant: *idempotency on
    writes that move money*). The DB index
    ``uq_virtual_cards_one_live_per_invoice`` only catches duplicates that made
    it into OUR database — if httpx times out *after* Lithic/Nium provisioned
    the card, no row is written, and an unkeyed retry mints a SECOND live card
    while the first is orphaned and ungoverned. A stable key closes that hole:
    the provider replays the original response instead of issuing again.

    Stability inputs, all durable:

    - ``correlation_id`` (falling back to ``invoice_id`` when an invoice
      predates correlation ids) — anchors the key to the payable, not to the
      attempt. Never a fresh uuid4.
    - ``reissue_seq`` — how many ``VirtualCard`` rows the invoice already has.
      A timed-out attempt persists nothing, so a retry recomputes the SAME
      sequence and therefore the same key. A deliberate cancel-then-reissue
      *does* leave a row behind, so it advances the sequence and gets a fresh
      key — without this, the provider would replay the original (now closed)
      card inside its key-retention window and the vendor would receive a dead
      card.

    Returned as a UUID string because that is the strictest provider
    requirement (Lithic rejects a non-UUID ``Idempotency-Key``); Nium's
    ``x-request-id`` accepts it happily.

    flush (``uq_virtual_cards_one_live_per_invoice``).

    The savepoint is what makes the loser recoverable. A bare ``db.flush()``
    that trips the index leaves the *enclosing* transaction in a needs-rollback
    state, so every subsequent statement on that session — the caller's audit
    row, its ``commit()`` — raises ``PendingRollbackError`` instead. On the
    payment-run path that unwound the whole dispatch loop and stranded the run
    in ``executing``; on the batch path it discarded the sibling cards already
    minted at the provider. Rolling back to the savepoint keeps the outer
    transaction healthy and turns a benign duplicate into a value the caller
    can branch on.

    ``db.add`` MUST happen INSIDE the savepoint block, never before it.
    ``SessionTransaction._take_snapshot`` flushes the session when a
    ``begin_nested()`` boundary opens, so a row added first is written by
    ``begin_nested()`` itself — *before* the SAVEPOINT exists — and its
    IntegrityError escapes the very block meant to contain it. That ordering
    trap is the reason this lives in one helper instead of being inlined at
    each call site.

    No explicit ``expunge`` is needed on the losing row: rolling back to the
    savepoint runs ``SessionTransaction._restore_snapshot``, which expunges
    ``session._new`` to transient — so a later ``flush``/``commit`` on this
    session cannot re-attempt the insert that just failed. (Asserted by the
    regression tests, which commit after a lost race and check exactly one row
    survives.) ``recurring_invoices.generate_one`` relies on the same behaviour;
