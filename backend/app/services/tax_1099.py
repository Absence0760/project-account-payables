"""1099 reporting + vendor tax bookkeeping.

US AP table stakes: track which vendors crossed the $600/year threshold,
whether a W-9 is on file, and what tax classification they reported. The
report endpoint is pure-query so it can be run ad-hoc during January
close without side effects.

This module is the aggregation layer. Form *generation* lives in
``tax_1099_forms`` (PDF), and *e-filing* lives in the
``tax_filing_adapters`` package + the ``POST /api/tax/1099/file``
endpoint — both reuse the rows this module computes. See
``backend/docs/tax-1099.md``.

Public API:
    - ``build_1099_report(db, organization_id, year)`` — compute the list
    - ``build_1099_dashboard(db, organization_id, year)`` — readiness view
    - ``THRESHOLD_USD`` — $600, the IRS filing threshold
    - ``BOX_CATALOG`` / ``resolve_box_mapping`` / ``allocate_boxes`` — the
      per-box allocation of a vendor's reportable total (see the section
      comment above ``BOX_CATALOG``)

# 1099 box allocation
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# A 1099 is not one number in one box. 1099-NEC has a single relevant box
# (1, nonemployee compensation) but 1099-MISC splits across several, and a
# vendor whose spend spans categories — rent AND medical AND legal — is
# mis-filed if the whole reportable total is dumped into whichever box the
# caller happened to ask for. That was the shipped simplification this
# section removes.
#
# The driver is the money's own coding: each completed payment settles an
# invoice, and the invoice carries the GL account AP coded it to
# (``Invoice.gl_account``). A per-org GL-account → box mapping on
# ``Organization.settings.tax.boxes`` (JSON, no migration — the same place
# every other per-org tax setting lives) turns that coding into a box.
#
# **The allocation reconciles by construction, not by rounding.** Nothing is
# prorated or split by percentage: every payment lands WHOLE in exactly one
# box, so the per-box Decimals sum to the vendor's reportable total to the
# cent with no residual to lose. Spend no rule matches is not dropped and not
# quietly folded — it lands in an explicit, named fallback box (default
# ``NEC-1``, matching the prior NEC behaviour exactly) and is separately
# surfaced as ``unmapped_paid`` / ``unmapped_payment_count`` so a preparer can
# see precisely how much money is sitting in the fallback for want of a rule.

    """Aggregate completed payments per vendor for the given calendar year.

    Only payments with ``status='completed'`` and a ``completed_at`` in
    the target year are counted — pending/failed payments don't show up
    on a 1099. ``completed_at`` is preferred over the invoice date
    because the IRS reports payments in the year they were actually made.

    **Card-rail payments are excluded from ``ytd_paid``** and totalled
    separately on ``card_paid``: the card settlement entity reports those on a
    Form 1099-K, so putting them in our 1099 box amount over-reports the
    vendor and double-counts the same dollar. The classification lives in
    ``services/payment_methods`` — see that module for the rail-by-rail
    treatment and the drift guard.

    ``reporting_currency`` is the org's reporting (home) currency, resolved by
    the caller via ``currency_conversion.resolve_reporting_currency``. It is
    **not** a label applied to whatever the SUM produced: ``Payment.amount`` is
    denominated in the INVOICE's currency (see
    ``international_payments.prepare_international_payment``), so a book with
    one EUR invoice in it used to add 1 000 EUR into a USD box amount at face
    value. ``currency_conversion.payment_reporting_amount_sql`` resolves each
    payment's outflow into ``reporting_currency`` — the rate-locked
    ``source_amount`` when the payment carries a home-currency leg, otherwise
    ``amount`` when the invoice is already in that currency — and a payment
    neither rung can establish is left OUT of ``ytd_paid`` / ``card_paid`` and
    counted on ``unconverted_payment_count`` instead. Nothing is converted at
    read time; a rate fetched on a read would make a filed historical total
    move under the reader.

    ``org_settings`` carries the per-org GL-account → 1099-box mapping
    (``settings.tax.boxes``). The aggregation groups by the paying invoice's
    ``gl_account`` as well as by vendor, and every GL bucket is attributed
    WHOLE to one box, so the per-box figures sum to ``ytd_paid`` to the cent.
    Omit it and every vendor's spend lands in the default fallback box
    (``NEC-1``) — exactly the pre-allocation behaviour — with the amount
    surfaced on ``unmapped_paid`` rather than presented as a mapped figure.
    """
