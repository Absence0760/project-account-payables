"""Redis-backed sliding-window rate limiter.

Used to cap abuse vectors on unauthenticated endpoints (signup, captcha).
Each bucket is a Redis key holding a sorted-set of timestamps; we trim
entries older than the window and count what remains. ZADD/ZREMRANGEBYSCORE/
ZCARD are all O(log n) and run in a single MULTI.

Scope: one counter per (endpoint, client IP). For shared-IP networks this
is coarse but acceptable for the low-volume abuse surface of tenant signup.

This module also owns the **per-identity authentication-failure throttle**
(bottom half): the per-IP brake above cannot see a credential-stuffing or
TOTP-guessing run distributed across rotating source addresses, which is the
cheap, commodity shape of that attack. See ``check_auth_failures``.

# Per-identity authentication-failure throttle
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The limiter above buckets on the client IP. That stops one host hammering an
# endpoint, but it is blind to the actual shape of a modern password spray or
# second-factor guessing run: the same account attacked from thousands of
# residential-proxy addresses, each staying comfortably under the per-IP cap.
# The primitives below add the missing axis — a counter keyed on the IDENTITY
# being authenticated, so the budget is shared across every source address.
#
# Three properties make this safe to put in front of a login form:
#
#   1. **Failures only.** ``check_auth_failures`` never records anything; only
#      ``record_auth_failure`` does, and a successful authentication calls
#      ``clear_auth_failures``. A user typing the right credential is therefore
#      never counted against, however often they sign in.
#   2. **Keyed on the SUBMITTED identifier, checked before the account lookup.**
#      An address with no account throttles exactly like one that has an
#      account, so the 429 can never be used as an account-existence oracle.
#   3. **Hashed.** The identifier is digested before it becomes a Redis key, so
#      an email address never lands in the keyspace (or in anything that dumps
#      it, e.g. `redis-cli --scan`).
#
# Accepted trade-off: because the bucket is keyed on the identity, an attacker
# who knows an address can burn that account's *password* budget and delay a
# legitimate sign-in until the window rolls off. That is bounded (a rolling
# window, never a sticky lock), self-healing, and does not touch the SSO or
# passkey paths — which is the same call every mainstream implementation makes,
# and strictly better than leaving the spray unbounded.
