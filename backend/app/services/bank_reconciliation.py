"""Bank statement import + reconciliation matcher.

Two responsibilities:

  1. **Import** — parse a CSV bank-statement export into
     `BankStatement` + `BankTransaction` rows. CSV is the only
     format we ship today; OFX and camt.053 hook in via the
     `source_format` parameter and a separate parser, deferred.

  2. **Match** — for every debit transaction, find the Payment row
     it corresponds to. Three strategies in order:
       a. **provider_id** — exact match of the transaction
          `reference` against `Payment.provider_payment_id` or
          `Payment.reference`. Confidence 100.
       b. **amount + date** — same amount within a ±N-day window
          of `Payment.submitted_at`. Confidence 80.
       c. **fuzzy vendor** — same amount within window + the
          transaction's `counterparty_name` matches the invoice's
          `vendor_name` via the same fuzzy logic vendor matching
          uses (token Jaccard). Confidence is the Jaccard score
          scaled into 50–70.

**Identity is not reconciliation.** Strategy (a) matches on a
reference string alone, so it can identify a payment while the bank
did something our books don't support:

  * a *different amount* than we authorised — a wire that left at
    $50,000 against a $5,000 instruction, an altered cheque, a
    duplicated fee → `amount_mismatch`;
  * a *different currency* than the payment settles in — a €1,000
    debit against a $1,000 payment → `currency_mismatch`;
  * a payment our books say never went out at all (`failed`,
    `voided`, `cancelled`, still `pending`) → `status_conflict`.

Each of those is linked to its payment (so nothing else can claim it)
yet NOT counted as reconciled, and the signed variance
(`match_variance`, positive = the bank took MORE than we authorised)
is surfaced on the API. This mirrors the `amount_mismatch`
classification the other two reconcilers already have —
`positive_pay.classify_presented_items` (altered cheque) and
`vendor_statement_recon` (statement line vs our ledger). Strategies
(b) and (c) key off an exact amount + currency and only consider
payments our books say were dispatched, so only (a) can produce one:
a heuristic has no identity proof, and inventing a "discrepancy" out
of a coincidence would be worse than leaving the line unmatched.

**What "the payment's amount" means to a bank line.** The account is
debited in the currency the money *leaves* in. For a domestic payment
that's `Payment.amount` in the invoice's currency; for one carrying an
FX leg it's `Payment.source_amount` in `Payment.source_currency`
(`services.international_payments` locks both at submission). The
`settlement_amount_and_currency` helper is the single definition of
that pair — `settlement_amount_sql` is its SQL mirror for aggregates.

A transaction with NO match stays `matched_payment_id=NULL`. Today
the AP team reviews unmatched transactions from the statement detail
view (`GET /api/bank-reconciliation/{id}`) and resolves them by hand
via `POST .../transactions/{id}/resolve` — there is no automatic
`Exception` row yet (unlike `invoice_warnings.py`'s duplicate/fraud
checks). Wiring an `unmatched_bank_transaction` exception type into
the queue is tracked as follow-up work; see
`docs/bank-reconciliation.md` § Deferred.
