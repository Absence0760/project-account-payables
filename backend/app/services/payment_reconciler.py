"""Payment-status reconciliation sweeper.

When a payment lands at a real processor we expect the webhook to drive
the status to its terminal state (`completed` / `failed`). Webhooks
get lost — endpoint flapping, spurious 5xx, signature drift after a
secret rotation. Without backstop polling, a stuck `submitted` row is
indistinguishable from one that's still legitimately in flight.

This module sweeps every tenant DB on a timer and re-polls each
non-terminal payment's status via the configured adapter. Status is
written back the same way the webhook handler does it. Old enough
non-terminal rows get marked `failed` to clear the queue (operators can
still investigate via the audit log).

Modeled after services/extraction_reaper.py and
services/approval_escalation.py — same async-loop shape.

    completed, and flag a discrepancy.

    ``get_payment_status`` returns a bare ``PaymentStatus`` by design, so a
    payment resolved by the backstop reached ``completed`` with no settled
    figure on record — and the coverage check fails open on NULL, so its
    invoice would be discharged on a settlement nobody verified. Precisely the
    case the backstop exists for (the webhook never arrived) was the case with
    the least evidence.

    This used to persist the figure and stop there — no verdict, no audit
    block, no exception — so a rail reporting a 10x overpayment settled
    silently (over-settlement is `covered` by design) and a short settlement
    stranded the invoice at `payment_scheduled` with nothing in the queue to
    explain it. And because `payment_webhook` refuses an already-terminal
    payment, a late webhook could never supply the missing verdict.

    Now it runs the SAME `record_settlement` + `open_settlement_mismatch_exception`
    pair the webhook does, so the two paths a payment can reach `completed` on
    cannot disagree about what "verified" means.

    Best-effort on every axis, like every other optional-capability call: an
    adapter without ``fetch_settlement`` reports ``available=False``, and any
    failure leaves the verdict `unverified` rather than halting the sweep.

    ``reported_amount`` / ``reported_currency`` are the figure the caller
    already resolved. The sweep passes what ``_prefetch_settlement`` obtained
    **outside** the row lock, together with ``_PREFETCHED_ONLY`` as the
    ``adapter``, so no processor round trip can happen while the lock is held.
