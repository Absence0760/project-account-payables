"""Vendor-portal notification preferences + email fan-out.

Mirrors `services/notification_dispatch.py` (which serves control-plane
`User`s) but for `VendorUser`s — the suppliers who own a given invoice. A
vendor controls, per portal user, whether they get **emailed** when one of
their own invoices is paid or rejected. Vendors have no in-app notification
center, so only the `email` channel exists here.

Two public surfaces:

- `prefs_to_response` / `apply_pref_update` — pure mapping between the stored
  `VendorUser.notification_prefs` JSONB blob (keyed by the same event_type
  strings the rest of the system uses, e.g. `invoice_paid`) and the
  vendor-friendly API shape (`email_on_payment` / `email_on_rejection`).
- `notify_vendor_of_invoice_event` — best-effort: load the invoice's vendor's
  active portal users, and email each one whose pref allows it. Never raises;
  a failure must never break the invoice status transition that triggered it.

PII rule: emails reuse the shared PII-free invoice templates
(`notification_templates.render`), and failures log the event type only —
never a recipient address or any banking field.
