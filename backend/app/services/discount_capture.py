"""Recognize a settled payment as the realization of an accepted early-pay
discount — the missing caller for ``discount_offers.mark_captured``.

``services/discount_offers.mark_captured`` is the only code that sets
``DiscountOffer.captured_amount`` / ``captured_at`` and transitions an offer
``accepted -> captured``, but it is a pure mutator: something has to notice
"this payment settling this invoice IS the discounted payoff" and call it.
This module is that something. It is invoked from every place a ``Payment``
reaches ``completed`` against an invoice — the synchronous adapter/card leg
in ``app/api/payments.py::_execute_single_payment`` and the async
webhook-driven completion in ``app/api/payments.py::payment_webhook`` — so a
discount is recognized whether the rail confirms instantly (mock, virtual
card) or days later (ACH/wire via a processor webhook).

Money is ``Decimal`` throughout; this module does its own DB query but never
commits — same convention as the rest of the payment path (the caller owns
the transaction).

    """Capture any ``accepted`` invoice-scoped ``DiscountOffer`` on
    ``invoice_id`` whose accepted tier's discounted payoff exactly matches
    ``payment_amount``.

    Only invoice-scoped offers are considered (``scope == "invoice"``) — a
    vendor-scoped bulk offer's ``base_amount`` is the summed open balance
    across several invoices, so no single invoice's payment can be proven to
    BE that offer's settlement; guessing would misattribute savings, so those
    are left ``accepted`` for a future reconciliation pass rather than
    auto-captured here.

    **Currency is checked before amount.** `POST /api/discounts/offers` lets
    the caller set an explicit ``currency`` independent of the invoice
    (falling back to ``invoice.currency`` only when omitted — see
    ``api/discounts.py::create_offer``), so an offer's currency can diverge
    from its own invoice's (data-entry mistake, or a currency-mismatched
    negotiation). ``Payment.amount`` is always denominated in the invoice's
    own currency. Without this check, a numeric coincidence between
    ``payment_amount`` and a differently-denominated offer's discounted
    payoff would be treated as proof of a discounted settlement and
    permanently mark it ``captured`` — the same misreporting-to-the-CFO risk
    the amount-exactness rule below guards against, just via a currency
    mismatch instead of a rounding one. Comparison is case-insensitive
    (``.upper()`` both sides) to match the uppercasing every write path
    already applies (`discounts.py`, `discount_auto_trigger.py`).

    The match is an EXACT cent comparison — ``payment_amount`` against
    ``offer.base_amount - discount_savings(base_amount, accepted_tier)``,
    both cent-quantized the same way — not a tolerance band. A payment for
    the full (undiscounted) amount, or for any other amount, leaves the
    offer ``accepted`` rather than being guessed at; a false "captured"
    would misreport realized savings to the CFO dashboard just as badly as
    the missing-caller bug this closes.

    Idempotent: only offers currently ``accepted`` are queried, so calling
    this again for the same settlement (a retry, a reconciliation re-run)
    finds nothing left to capture — never double-counts, never raises on an
    already-``captured`` offer. The ``mark_captured`` ``ValueError`` is also
    caught defensively in case a concurrent settlement path captured the same
    offer between the query and the mutation.

    Returns the offers captured (0 in the common no-discount case, 1 when a
    discounted payoff was recognized; a list because nothing stops more than
    one ``accepted`` offer existing on the same invoice at once).
