    restore, or an importer that serialises absence as JSON ``null``. Every one
    of those means "no chain here"; the next approval re-initialises one.

    That is why the coercion is ``or {}`` and **not** ``.get(key, {})``. The

    unblock it with `escalation_to_user_ids` and record an escalation event.
    Returns True if the instance was mutated.

    `any` mode: the escalation targets are ADDED to `approver_ids` — a new
    eligible approver who can independently clear the level's `required`
    count, unaffected by whether the original approvers ever act.

    `all` mode: every id in `approver_ids` must approve, so simply appending
    would make an already-stuck level need MORE sign-offs than before —
    the opposite of "unblock" (issue #128). Instead, every approver who
    hasn't yet approved is SUBSTITUTED with the escalation targets (approvers
    who already signed off are kept — their approval still counts); the
    level's requirement shrinks to "already-approved + escalation targets"
    rather than growing to "everyone, plus the escalation targets too".

    An **unrestricted** level (empty `approver_ids`) is a no-op in BOTH modes.
    `check_level_approver` treats an empty allow-list as "any actor who cleared
    the endpoint's RBAC gate may approve", so the escalation targets are
    already eligible and there is nothing to add. Writing them in would turn
    `[]` into `[target…]` — *narrowing* an open level to those users alone and
    403-ing the entire AP team that could approve it a moment earlier. That is
    the same inversion issue #128 fixed for `all` mode, arriving through the
    empty-list case instead; an escalation must never shrink who may approve.
    (Such a level is never eligibility-blocked in the first place: `any` mode
    counts distinct approvals without consulting `approver_ids`, and `all` mode
    over an empty list is satisfied by the first approval.)
