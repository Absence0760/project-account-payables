    is governed by the config it entered under, not the live definition), and —
    only when there is no snapshot to read — the org's currently-active
    definition as a **fail-closed** fallback.

    That fallback is the whole point. Not every invoice has a
    ``WorkflowInstance``: the email-intake and PEPPOL-inbound ingest paths
    create the row without one, and so does any legacy / directly-inserted
    invoice. Returning ``{}`` there did not mean "no rules apply" — it meant the
    max-amount cap, the CFO gate, the structuring guard and the named-approver
    check were ALL skipped, so a $50,000 invoice that arrived by email cleared a
    $1,000 ``require_cfo_above`` on a lone ap_manager's approval. A money
    control must not be contingent on a bookkeeping row existing.

    Resolution is read-only (``resolve_active_workflow_definition``, never the
    get-or-CREATE variant) — a definition must never appear as a side effect of
    an approval. ``{}`` now means only "this org has no active definition, or
    its definition has no approval step", which is genuinely nothing to enforce.

    Pass ``instance`` when the caller already loaded it, to save a query.
