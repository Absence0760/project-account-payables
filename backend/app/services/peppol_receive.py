"""PEPPOL AS4 inbound receive service (the receiver corner, C4).

A receiver's Access Point (C3) delivers an inbound BIS Billing 3.0 document to
us (C4) by POSTing the UBL/CII payload + metadata (sender participant id, AS4
MessageId, doc type, process id) to our per-tenant webhook with a provider HMAC
signature. This module turns that delivery into an :class:`Invoice` the AP team
sees in their queue — mirroring :func:`email_intake.process_inbound_email`
(create Invoice → upload payload → ``dispatch_extraction``) and the idempotency
discipline of :mod:`peppol_send`.

Dedupe is enforced at the DATA layer, not by app logic. The AS4 ``MessageId``
is the dedupe key; a redelivery repeats it. Two layers, the DB authoritative:

1. Fast path (advisory): a SELECT on ``message_id`` short-circuits the common
   sequential redelivery without creating an invoice.
2. Authoritative guarantee (the concurrent-redelivery race): both redeliveries
   can pass the SELECT, but the partial unique index ``uq_peppol_message_id``
   lets only one ``PeppolTransmission`` INSERT commit. The loser's
   ``IntegrityError`` rolls back its ENTIRE tenant transaction — including the
   Invoice it created — so no second invoice survives. To avoid even an orphaned
   S3 object on the loser, the transmission row is flushed (claiming the slot)
   BEFORE the payload is uploaded, exactly as :mod:`peppol_send` claims its
   idempotency slot before the networked transmit.

Redis ``is_event_already_processed`` is deliberately NOT used here (unlike the
payment webhook): for a create-an-invoice one-time effect, the durable DB unique
index is the correct guarantee — a 24h Redis TTL would let a later redelivery
slip through and is redundant given the index.

PII invariant: the supplier's participant value (``sender_value``), tax id, and
addresses live legitimately on the row and inside the received UBL payload, but
NEVER enter a log line, an audit ``details`` payload, or an HTTP response.
``reason`` codes and audit details carry only PII-free scheme/message-id/doc-type
fields. Money (``amount``) is ``Decimal`` — never float.
