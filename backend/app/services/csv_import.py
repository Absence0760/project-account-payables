"""CSV importers for pilot-customer data migration.

Lets a new tenant bring their existing vendor list + open AP without
re-entering everything by hand. Runs entirely in-process against the
tenant DB (no S3, no extraction pipeline, no ERP sync) so it's safe to
use on Day 0 before those integrations are wired up.

Public API:
    - ``import_vendors_csv(db, organization_id, csv_text)``
    - ``import_invoices_csv(db, organization_id, csv_text)``
    - ``import_corporate_card_csv(db, organization_id, csv_text)``

Both return :class:`ImportResult`. Each row is processed independently
— one bad row does not abort the import. Callers are expected to
commit the session themselves after inspecting the result.

# Import provenance
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# An imported invoice is a HISTORICAL row copied in from whatever the tenant
# used before us. The workflow engine never ran on it, so it is evidence
# neither for nor against anything this platform did — and metrics that
# describe our own work (the touchless rate in `services/analytics`) have to
# be able to tell it apart from an invoice we actually processed.
#
# Status cannot answer that question: `done`, `paid` and `rejected` are all
# both importable AND reachable natively. So the importer records the fact
# directly, on the existing `Invoice.meta` JSONB bag (no migration).
#
# Shape — one reserved top-level key holding an object:
#
#     meta["imported"] = {"at": "<ISO-8601 UTC>", "source": "csv_import"}
#
# * A nested object, not a flat `imported_at`, so later provenance fields
#   (batch id, importing user) extend it without colonising more top-level
#   keys in a bag shared with `audit_summary` and `archived_at`.
# * PRESENCE of the key is the marker; nothing parses the value. A truncated
#   or hand-edited `at` still reads as "imported" rather than silently
#   flipping the row back to native.
# * `source` names the writer, so a future importer (an ERP backfill, a
#   migration tool) marks rows the same way and is distinguishable.
#
# This importer only ever writes the marker going forward, and nothing
# backfills it from the DATA: a row that predates it carries no key and is read
# as native, because absence means "we do not know", and inferring provenance
# for a historical row is exactly the guessing this exists to avoid.
#
# What a PERSON knows, the data cannot supply — so there is one other writer:
# `scripts/backfill_import_provenance.py`, where an operator ASSERTS the cutover
# date of a migration they ran. It stamps `source="operator_backfill"` with
# `asserted: true`, which is the `source`-names-the-writer rule above doing its
# job: a declared provenance stays distinguishable from a recorded one. It reads
# `_IMPORTABLE_INVOICE_STATUSES` from this module rather than restating it, and
# only ever REFUSES to mark — never marks a row this importer could not have
# created. See `backend/docs/analytics.md` § Imported rows are outside the
# metric.
