"""Signed, single-action tokens for out-of-app approval (email + Slack + Teams).

Originally minted for the email-approval link, this token is now also the
credential carried in the Slack approval message's interactive buttons and the
Microsoft Teams approval card's Action.Http buttons. A ``channel`` claim
(``email`` / ``slack`` / ``teams``) binds a token to its delivery surface so one
surface's token can't be replayed against another — see :data:`CHANNEL_EMAIL` /
:data:`CHANNEL_SLACK` / :data:`CHANNEL_TEAMS` and ``expected_channel`` on
:func:`verify_action_token`. The module name is kept for the email callers.

An AP reviewer who receives the "invoice assigned to you for review" email can
approve or reject the invoice straight from a link in that email — no login.
The link carries a **signed, expiring, single-action token** that IS the
credential: there is no JWT and no session. The token binds, under an
HMAC-SHA256 signature, the exact facts the action will run against:

    tenant_slug + invoice_id + actor_id (the reviewer) + action + expiry + jti

Because the platform holds the signing key (sops + KMS in deployed envs), the
token cannot be forged or tampered with — flipping the action, the invoice, or
the actor invalidates the signature. The action endpoint re-runs the *normal*
``services.review`` approve/reject path as that reviewer, so segregation of
duties, approval thresholds, the CFO gate, the immutable audit row, and the
approval digital-signature all still apply exactly as if they had logged in.

This module is **pure**: no DB, no network, no settings import. The signing key
and TTL are passed in by the caller. An empty key fails closed — ``build_*``
returns ``None`` (no link is added to the email) and ``verify_action_token``
returns ``None`` (every token is rejected) — mirroring the fail-closed posture
of :mod:`app.services.approval_signature` and
:func:`app.services.webhook_security.verify_hmac_sha256`. There is NO hardcoded
production fallback key.

Single-use is enforced two ways, layered:
  1. the workflow state machine — approve/reject move the invoice out of
     ``ready_for_review``, so a replay can't re-fire the same decision; and
  2. a Redis consume on the ``jti`` at the endpoint — which also closes the
     resubmit-replay window (a stale token reused after a reject→resubmit cycle).
This module only owns the token's integrity + expiry; the endpoint owns consume.
