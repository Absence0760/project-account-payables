"""Base billing-provider adapter interface + shared types.

A billing adapter wraps an external billing/subscription provider (Stripe
Billing, Chargebee, …). It is the seam between our control-plane ``Plan`` /
``Subscription`` model and the provider's hosted objects. This FIRST SLICE
defines the interface + a deterministic local-first ``mock`` (the default) and a
fail-closed ``stripe_billing`` skeleton with the correct wire shape.

The adapter NEVER moves money on its own and NEVER persists our models — it
talks to the provider and returns normalized DTOs; the caller persists.
