"""Shared webhook-security primitives.

Project invariant #9 says every inbound webhook must
  - verify the provider's HMAC over the raw bytes, and
  - dedupe by event id so a re-delivery doesn't replay a one-time
    effect (a settled payment, a card rebate, an ERP status flip).

The payment adapter implements its own HMAC verification inline. This
module exposes the same primitives in a form the card- and ERP-webhook
handlers (which don't go through the adapter abstraction) can reuse.

Dedup uses Redis with a TTL so retries within the provider's
re-delivery window are caught, but the key set doesn't grow without
bound. The 72-hour default covers the widest processor retry window we
integrate with (Lithic retries a failed delivery on an exponential
backoff over ~3 days); a shorter TTL would let a late redelivery slip
past the dedup and replay the one-time effect.
