"""Contract renewal alerts — background sweep that notifies before expiry.

Every tick:

  1. Enumerate tenant DBs from the control plane.
  2. For each tenant, find ``active`` contracts with an ``end_date``, no
     renewal alert sent yet, that fall within their own
     ``renewal_notice_days`` lead window (already-expired-but-unalerted
     contracts qualify too).
  3. Notify the contract owner + every AP manager, once, via
     ``notification_dispatch.notify_event`` (in-app + email, preference-gated).
  4. Stamp ``renewal_alert_sent_at = now()`` so the alert never re-fires for
     this term. ``POST /api/contracts/{id}/renew`` clears it, re-arming the
     alert for the new end date.
  5. Separately, find ``active`` contracts whose ``end_date`` has actually
     PASSED (not just approaching) and transition them to ``expired``,
     writing a ``contract.expired`` audit row. This is the only runtime path
     that ever sets ``ContractStatus.expired`` — without it a contract past
     its term stays ``active`` forever, spend-to-contract / renewal reporting
     treats it as still live, and the ``expired -> ...`` transition branches
     in ``api/contracts.py`` (``activate``/``terminate``) can never fire.

Idempotency (expiry pass)
--------------------------
Only ``active`` contracts are matched, and expiring one moves it out of
``active``. So a re-run never double-expires or double-audits — the status
guard is the dedupe, exactly like the ``renewal_alert_sent_at`` marker above
and the ``offered`` status guard in ``discount_auto_trigger``.

The alert pass's lead window is a real SQL predicate
(:func:`lead_window_predicate`), not a coarse date pre-filter refined in Python:
it used to select every ``active`` contract whose ``end_date`` fell inside
``today + 3650 days`` — i.e. effectively all of them — and discard the
out-of-window rows after loading. See ``backend/docs/background-sweeps.md``
§ Locking.

Mirrors the ``audit_log_shipper`` pattern: long-lived asyncio task started in
``main.lifespan``, fresh per-tenant engine, one tenant's failure logged but
never halts the sweep. Within a tenant it mirrors ``vendor_rescreen``: the two
passes are independent, and each contract is locked, re-checked and committed
**on its own** inside a ``try`` / ``rollback`` guard — so one bad contract can
neither abort the tick nor roll back the other pass's work (see
:func:`_sweep_tenant` and ``backend/docs/background-sweeps.md`` § Locking).
Disabled by default (``FEOH_CONTRACT_RENEWAL_ENABLED``).

    Two independent passes over the same session, each **committing per
    contract** inside its own ``try`` / ``rollback`` guard.

    Both passes used to share one transaction and one commit at the end of the
    tick, which coupled three things that have nothing to do with each other:

    1. One contract whose alert raised (a recipient lookup failing, a
       notification bug, an audit write that will not land) discarded every
       ``renewal_alert_sent_at`` stamp already made on that tick — so the
       recipients who HAD been emailed got the same alert again next tick,
       while the poison contract, being deterministic, aborted at exactly the
       same place forever and nothing after it was ever alerted.
    2. A raise in the **expiry** pass rolled back the whole **alert** pass, and
       vice versa — two unrelated controls, each able to silently undo the
       other's work.
    3. That tenant then made zero forward progress on either control, with the
       only trace a per-tenant counter the loop discarded.

    Candidate ids are selected unlocked and ordered by id (one lock order for
    every replica, so concurrent sweeps queue instead of deadlocking); each is
    re-read with ``FOR UPDATE`` and **re-checked against the predicate the id
    query used** — it can have changed under us (a renew, a terminate, a
    manual expiry) between the two statements. A leg with nothing to write ends
    in ``rollback()``, releasing the row lock immediately rather than at the end
    of the tick. Same shape as ``vendor_rescreen`` / ``recurring_invoices`` /
    ``approval_escalation``; see ``backend/docs/background-sweeps.md`` § Locking.

    **Both passes keyset-paginate** (``contract_renewal_batch_size`` per page,
    ``WHERE id > :cursor``) until the tenant is exhausted, each with its own
    cursor. A per-tick ``LIMIT`` is not available to either: a contract outside
    its lead window stays un-alerted and a not-yet-overdue one stays ``active``,
    so neither leaves the candidate set, and a cap would re-serve the same
    lowest-id contracts every tick and never reach the tail. Paging is safe
    across a page boundary for the same reason the two-phase shape is safe at
    all — the leg re-checks the predicate under the row lock, so a page taken
    after several commits is no more stale than the single unbounded read it
    replaces.
