"""Pure payment-plan assembler for the AI Cash-Flow Copilot (Phase 2).

``assemble_plan`` combines a cash-position baseline with the discount
optimizer's selection into a single **proposed plan** artifact: a
period-by-period pay schedule, which discount offers to capture, and the
resulting cash-position curve. It reuses the exact same pure functions the
Phase 1 tools already call (``services.analytics.bucket_outflows`` /
``compute_cash_position``, ``services.discount_optimizer.optimize`` via its
caller) — no DB, no network, no clock; every input (including ``today``) is
passed in, so a call is byte-reproducible.

**This never mutates anything.** It returns a proposal object; enacting it
(draft payment run / discount accept) is Phase 3, and lives in
``app/api/cash_flow.py``. See ``docs/cash-flow-copilot.md`` §5.

The bottom half of this module is the saved-plan / plan-vs-actual layer:
freezing a proposal's curve for JSONB storage on ``models.cash_plan.CashPlan``
and scoring it against what actually got paid. Still pure — the API layer
does the reading and writing.

Re-timing precision
--------------------
A selected recommendation whose opportunity carries an ``invoice_id`` that
matches one of ``rows`` is re-timed onto its ``pay_by`` period at its
discounted outlay (``base_amount - savings``) instead of sitting at the full
amount on its original due date — the plan literally proposes paying that
invoice early. A selected recommendation with no matching row (a
vendor-scoped offer with no single invoice, or an invoice whose due date
falls outside the forecast horizon) still counts toward
``total_savings_selected`` — the optimizer says it is worth capturing — but
there is no row to move, so it is left on its original schedule; its
``offer_id`` is listed in ``unretimed_offer_ids`` so the caller can be
transparent about the gap instead of silently overclaiming precision.

An offer the optimizer flagged ``unconvertible`` (its money is in a currency
the curve is not in) takes the same route, for the same reason stated
differently: there is no figure we could put on the curve that would be
correct. It contributes nothing to ``total_savings_selected`` either — the
optimizer already excluded it from that sum.
