"""Positive Pay — return classifier (pure) + file-item builders (async DB).

Positive Pay is a treasury fraud control. We give the bank the cheques we
*issued*; when an item is later presented for payment, the bank matches it
against that file and flags anything that doesn't line up. This module has two
halves:

  * **The pure return classifier** — :func:`classify_presented_items` takes the
    items the bank reports as *presented* and the items we *issued*, and labels
    each presented item ``matched_ok`` / ``amount_mismatch`` (an ALTERED cheque —
    fraud) / ``not_on_file`` (a cheque we never wrote — fraud). No DB, no I/O, no
    account numbers — just check numbers + amounts.

  * **The async file-item builders** — :func:`build_check_issue_items` and
    :func:`build_ach_authorization_items` project tenant rows (Payments /
    Vendors) into the formatter dataclasses the
    ``positive_pay_adapters`` layer renders. These touch the DB but never log a
    full account / routing number (PII invariant).

Money is :class:`~decimal.Decimal` (never float). See
``backend/docs/positive-pay.md``.
