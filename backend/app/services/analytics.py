"""Analytics — pure computation functions for CFO + operational
metrics. Caller hands in the raw row sets pulled from the DB; the
functions return Decimal / dict results that the API layer
serialises.

Splitting the SQL from the math keeps the math testable without a
DB. Every function in this module is sync + pure (no async, no IO).
The async layer lives in `app/api/analytics.py`.

Metrics shipped:

  Operational (`/api/dashboard`):
    - processing_time_metrics: avg upload→approval, upload→paid,
      median + p95 variants
    - approval_bottleneck: per-approver pending counts, oldest
      pending, average time-in-queue
    - discount_capture_rate: discount-eligible captured vs missed

  CFO (`/api/analytics/cfo`):
    - days_payable_outstanding (DPO) trend
    - cash_conversion_cycle (DSO + DIO − DPO)
    - accruals: open POs + GR − invoices not yet posted
    - working_capital_impact: "if we paid N days later"
    - supplier_concentration: top-10 / top-50 spend share
    - fraud_rate_trend: exceptions per invoice, by type, monthly
    - early_pay_discount_roi: discount $ captured vs missed
    - rebate_yield: virtual-card rebates / total spend
    - forecast_variance: actual vs forecast outflow
    - cashflow_forecast (`bucket_outflows`): projected AP outflows
      bucketed by day / week / month from committed + pending
      invoices
    - cashflow_whatif (`apply_payment_timing_scenario`): early vs
      on-time vs late payment-timing scenarios, with early-pay
      discount capture
    - cash_position (`compute_cash_position` +
      `detect_threshold_breaches`): running balance from a
      bring-your-own opening balance, with threshold-breach alerts

Drill-through: every metric has a corresponding "give me the rows
that produced this number" function; the API layer exposes those
under `/api/analytics/drill/<metric>`.

#
# DEFINITION (decided, not inherited — see `docs/analytics.md`):
#   "passed review without human touch".
#
# The population is every invoice that PROVABLY reached and finished the
# review stage. The numerator is the ones that cleared it without a human
# bouncing them back; the denominator adds the ones a human rejected. An
# invoice that never entered review is in NEITHER leg — it is evidence
# neither for nor against touchless processing.
#
# The rate is a claim about how much work the machine did instead of a
# person, so the numerator requires POSITIVE EVIDENCE that review happened.
# A terminal status is not that evidence: `new -> done` is a legal
# `VALID_TRANSITIONS` edge that skips approval outright, and the Day-0 CSV
# importer (`services/csv_import`) plants historical rows straight at `done`
# (its default) or `paid` without the workflow engine running at all.
# Counting those as "cleared review" inflates exactly the figure leadership
# reads.

# Statuses an invoice can ONLY be in because review finished and it cleared:
# every `VALID_TRANSITIONS` edge into them originates at `approved`, and every
# writer of `approved` stamps `Invoice.approval_date`. Status alone is proof
# here, so no extra evidence is needed.

#   `failed` — from `pending` (extraction failed, never reviewed) OR from
#              `sending_to_erp` (approved, then the ERP export blew up).

# no approval stamp on a rejection (nothing writes one), so this leg cannot be
# evidence-gated the way the cleared leg is; a rejected row IS the evidence
# that a human touched it.
#
# That asymmetry is why provenance, not evidence, is what removes an IMPORTED
# rejection: `services/csv_import` can plant a historical `rejected` row, and
# gating this leg on an approval stamp would zero the bounced population
# outright (no rejection ever carries one) rather than exclude the imports.

#     handled, since it carries no approval stamp), and
#   * an imported `rejected` row DEFLATES the rate — it lands in the bounced
#     leg as though a reviewer here had sent it back.
#
# Provenance is what settles this, not status: `done`, `paid` and `rejected`
# are each reachable BOTH natively and by import, so no status set can tell
# them apart. `services/csv_import` stamps every row it creates with the
# `meta["imported"]` marker (`imported_invoice_clause` is its SQL predicate);
# the caller counts marked rows per status and passes them in.
#
# An UNMARKED row is treated as native, deliberately: the marker is written
# only going forward and is never backfilled, so absence means "we do not
# know". Rows imported before it shipped stay in the population — stated in
# `docs/analytics.md` rather than papered over with an invented provenance.

    ``outflow_periods`` is the list returned by ``bucket_outflows``.

    balance: those rows entered the outflow at face value in another currency,
