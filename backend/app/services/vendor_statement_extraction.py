"""PDF supplier-statement intake — the bridge from the extraction pipeline to
the reconciliation engine.

A supplier that sends its statement of open items as a PDF used to have to be
transcribed by hand: the CSV and pasted-lines paths both shipped, the PDF one
didn't. This module closes that by routing the PDF through the **existing**
extraction pipeline — the org's own configured adapter, resolved by the same
platform-vs-BYOK rules invoices use — rather than standing up a second parser
with its own provider config and its own failure modes.

What lives here is only the glue:

* pick the adapter (:func:`resolve_statement_adapter`),
* call the optional ``extract_statement`` capability, never letting a provider
  failure escape as a 500,
* normalise the adapter's RAW strings into the reconciliation engine's
  ``Decimal`` / ``date`` dataclasses.

The matching itself is untouched: the normalised lines go into the same pure
``vendor_statement_recon.reconcile`` the CSV and manual paths feed, so a PDF run
and a CSV run are the same run.

**Fail closed.** Every failure — provider can't do it, provider errored,
document has no readable open items — raises :class:`StatementExtractionError`,
which the router turns into a 422. Nothing in here ever produces a partial or
inferred statement line: on this feature an invented open item is money a clerk
then chases the supplier for.

See ``backend/docs/vendor-statement-reconciliation.md`` § PDF intake.
