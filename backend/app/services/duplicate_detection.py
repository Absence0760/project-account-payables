"""Semantic duplicate detection via pgvector.

Complements the rule-based duplicate check in `invoice_warnings.py` (which
matches on exact `vendor_name + invoice_number`). Catches near-duplicates
where text overlap is very high but strings differ slightly — re-uploads,
resends from the same vendor with one field changed, OCR-whitespace drift.

The threshold (FEOH_DUPLICATE_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD, default 0.95) is
intentionally tighter than the RAG-retrieval threshold. RAG wants
semantically-related-but-distinct invoices for few-shot context;
duplicate detection wants near-identical invoices. A recurring monthly
invoice from the same vendor with a new amount/date typically lands in
the 0.85-0.93 range and should NOT be flagged.

Multi-entity: the SEARCH is deliberately cross-entity, the WARNING is not
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Every sibling reader is entity-scoped — `rag.retrieve_similar` takes an
`entity_id`, the assistant's `find_invoices_by_text` threads it "so 'search'
can't silently widen past the subsidiary the user has selected", and
`vendor_matching._candidate_query` scopes for the same reason. This one is
different **on purpose**.

The same invoice billed to two subsidiaries of one group is a *real* duplicate
and exactly what a group AP team wants caught — it is the intra-group double-bill
the control exists for. Scoping the search would remove a genuine control to fix
a disclosure problem, so we keep the search wide.

What was actually wrong is what the finding *said*. `matches_to_warning` put the
matched invoice's `invoice_number`, `vendor_name` and `amount` into
`invoice.warnings`, which the detail modal renders — data from an entity the
viewer is otherwise scoped away from. So a cross-entity match now reports only
its existence ("a near-identical invoice exists under another entity") with those
three fields **redacted**; a same-entity match is unchanged and still names them,
because there the viewer is entitled to the detail and needs it to act.

The `duplicate` Exception this raises is in
`api/payments.PAYMENT_BLOCKING_EXCEPTION_TYPES`, so a cross-entity hit still
blocks the payment run until a human clears it. That is the intended behaviour
for a suspected group double-bill — the human sign-off is the control — and the
clearing path is unchanged.
