"""Approval escalation sweeper.

When a chain level has been waiting longer than its configured
``escalation_hours`` without enough approvals to advance, this sweeper
appends the level's ``escalation_to_user_ids`` onto its ``approver_ids``
list — so those users become eligible to approve and unblock the chain.

The mutation lives in JSONB on `WorkflowInstance.state_data.approval_levels`
and is idempotent (no-op once a level has been escalated to a given user
set), so the sweeper is safe to run on a tight interval and across
overlapping replicas.

Pure async — runs as a long-lived asyncio task started in `main.lifespan`.
Cancelling the task (server shutdown) is handled cleanly. Also exposed as
a CLI: `python scripts/sweep_approval_escalations.py`.

    Returns ``(escalated, failed_instances)``.

    Reads only `state="active"` rows carrying an ``approval_levels`` chain —
    completed/abandoned instances don't move money, and one with no chain can
    never escalate, so neither is worth locking.

    **Two-phase, one row locked at a time.** Candidate ids are selected
    UNLOCKED, keyset-paginated by id (``approval_escalation_batch_size`` per
    page); each id is then re-read with ``FOR UPDATE``, escalated, and committed
    on its own, which releases the lock before the next row is touched. The
    sweep used to select every active instance ``FOR UPDATE`` in one unbounded
    statement and hold all of it to the end of the tick: ``review.approve_invoice``
    takes the same row lock, so a tenant with a large open queue had its ENTIRE
    approval surface blocked behind each tick, and two replicas locking
    overlapping sets in unspecified order deadlocked and aborted the tick.
    Ordering by id gives every replica the same lock order, so they queue
    instead of deadlocking.

    Paginating rather than capping is deliberate: escalation does not change
    ``state``, so a capped sweep would re-examine the same lowest-id rows every
    tick and never reach the rest. The row lock still serialises against a
    concurrent approval — escalation either waits for it to commit (then reads
    the fresh ``state_data``) or holds the one row while it escalates.

    Each escalation writes an ``invoice.approval_escalated`` audit row —
    expanding who may approve an invoice is a material control event and must be
    reconstructable from the immutable trail, not just mutable state_data.
