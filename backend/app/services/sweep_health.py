"""In-process health registry + shared loop runner for the background sweeps.

Every long-lived sweep started in ``main.lifespan`` used to carry its own copy
of the same ``while True: try: await <sweep>_once() ...`` boilerplate, and every
copy **discarded the result**. Twelve of the fourteen ``*_once`` functions
already return a result dataclass carrying a ``failures: int``; nothing read it.
The counter's only consumer was a conditional aggregate ``logger.info`` inside
``*_once`` itself — never persisted, never exposed, never alerted on. A sink
misconfigured for months (the ``audit_shipping`` adapters raising by design, so
the SOC 2 WORM evidence never leaves the tenant DB) looked identical to one
running clean.

This module is the single mechanism that closes that. It owns three things:

1. **`run_sweep_loop`** — the one loop body every ``run_*_loop`` delegates to.
   It ticks, records the outcome here, sleeps, and re-raises ``CancelledError``
   on shutdown. Fourteen copies of the boilerplate became one, so the sweeps
   can no longer drift apart in how they handle (or fail to handle) a failure.
2. **The registry** — per-sweep last-run timestamps, last outcome, the
   consecutive-failure streak, lifetime run counts, and the *integer* counts the
   sweep's own result dataclass reported.
3. **Supervision** — ``supervise_task`` attaches an ``add_done_callback`` so a
   sweep task that dies (rather than being cancelled at shutdown) is recorded
   and logged instead of vanishing silently.

**PII discipline.** Only an exception's **class name** is ever recorded or
logged — never ``str(exc)``, and never ``exc_info``. The stdlib logging module
appends the full traceback (including the exception text) whenever ``exc_info``
is passed, regardless of what the format string names, so passing it would leak
exactly the vendor names / account fragments this discipline exists to keep out
of the log sink. The recorded counts are integers off the sweep's own result
dataclass — no org name, tenant slug, or row identifier is stored.

**Scope.** State is per-process and in-memory: a restart resets it, and each
replica reports its own view. That is deliberate — a durable per-sweep run table
would be a migration fanned out to every tenant DB for platform-level (not
tenant-level) telemetry, and there is no platform-scoped settings row to hang a
JSON marker off. The consumers are ``GET /api/health/sweeps`` (per-replica, the
question an operator actually asks of a suspect process) and the PII-free
"not making progress" ERROR log, which is the alertable signal in a deployed
environment. See ``../docs/decisions.md`` §24.
