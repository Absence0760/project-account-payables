"""Self-service password recovery for the main AP app (main app only — the
supplier portal is out of scope; see `docs/authentication.md`).

A user who forgot their password requests a reset link
(``POST /api/auth/forgot-password``), gets emailed a single-use token, and
redeems it (``POST /api/auth/reset-password``) to set a new one. This module
owns only the token primitive; ``app/api/auth.py`` owns the rate limiting,
the (org-scoped) user lookup, the enumeration-resistant response, and the
email send.

Mirrors the MFA pending-enrollment / email-OTP Redis patterns in
``services/mfa.py``: no DB row for the token — it lives in Redis, keyed by a
digest of the token itself, mapped to the user id, with a short TTL. A stray
un-redeemed reset link needs no garbage collection; it just expires.
Consuming a token (:func:`consume_reset_token`) is a single atomic
``GETDEL``, so two concurrent redemptions of the same token can't both
succeed — the second sees nothing, same as an already-expired one.
