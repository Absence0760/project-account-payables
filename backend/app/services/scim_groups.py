"""SCIM 2.0 group storage + group→role reconciliation.

Groups are low-cardinality per tenant (a handful of IdP groups), and the only
thing we *do* with a group is map it to an RBAC `Role`. So group state lives as
JSONB on `Organization.settings.sso` alongside the rest of the SSO config —
no dedicated table (the upgrade path if group volume ever grows is a
control-plane `scim_groups` table; the endpoint/service boundary here stays the
same). Roles remain the real RBAC primitive (`roles` / `user_roles`).

Storage shape (`settings.sso`):
    "scim_groups": {
        "<group-uuid>": {
            "displayName": "AP Managers",
            "externalId": "<idp-group-id>",
            "members": ["<userId>", ...],
            "created": "<iso>",
            "lastModified": "<iso>",
        }
    }
    "scim_group_role_map": { "AP Managers": "ap_manager", ... }

Mapping contract: a role named in `scim_group_role_map` becomes **IdP-managed**
for any user the IdP places in (or removes from) a mapped group — reconciliation
grants/revokes exactly those roles based on group membership, and never touches
roles outside the map (manual / JIT assignments are preserved).
