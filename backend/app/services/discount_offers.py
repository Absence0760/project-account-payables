"""Dynamic-discount offer logic — sliding-scale tiers + lifecycle + bulk negotiation.

A :class:`~app.models.discount.DiscountOffer` is a time-boxed early-payment
proposal, optionally a *sliding scale* of tiers (pay sooner → bigger discount):

    [{"days": 5, "percent": "3.00"}, {"days": 10, "percent": "2.00"}]

This module is the pure business logic behind that model — tier normalization,
"which tier can we still capture today", exact-cents savings math, and the
accept / decline / capture / expire transitions. It does **no** DB or network
work: the lifecycle helpers *mutate* a passed-in offer-like object inside a
session the caller (the ``/api/discounts`` router) owns and commits. ROI math
is **not** duplicated here — that lives in ``services/discount_roi.py``.

Tier semantics (the rule chosen here, applied consistently)
-----------------------------------------------------------
A tier ``{"days": N, "percent": P}`` means: *"pay within ``N`` days of the
offer's reference date to earn ``P`` % off."* The capture **deadline** for that
rung is ``reference_date + N days``. As of some ``as_of`` date a tier is still
*achievable* when ``as_of <= reference + N``.

:func:`offer_reference_date` is the one resolver for that reference —
``valid_from`` when set, else the offer's ``created_at`` date — and **every**
caller must go through it. Passing ``offer.valid_from`` directly leaves a NULL
falling through to ``as_of`` (today), which makes each rung's deadline roll
forward one day per day and the offer never age.

When several tiers are still achievable, :func:`best_tier_for_date` returns the
one with the **highest percent** (best for the buyer) — which, because percent
decreases as the window widens, is the *tightest still-open* window. The whole
offer is dead once ``valid_until`` has passed (``as_of > valid_until``):
:func:`best_tier_for_date` then returns ``None`` regardless of the tiers.

Money is ``Decimal`` and tier percents are carried as Decimal-strings (never
float) to match the JSONB storage on the model. See
``backend/docs/dynamic-discounting.md``.
