"""Corporate-card transaction reconciliation (Expense Management WF4).

Two responsibilities, both pure-ish helpers the ``expense_cards`` router calls:

  1. **Match suggestions** — for a card transaction, find candidate ``Expense``
     rows it could reconcile against. Strategy mirrors
     ``bank_reconciliation.py``: amount-exact + ``expense_date`` within a
     ±N-day window of ``txn_date``, ranked by an optional fuzzy merchant score
     (token Jaccard via ``vendor_matching``). Only unmatched expenses
     (``card_transaction_id IS NULL``) are eligible. Money compares as exact
     ``Decimal`` — never float.

  2. **Virtual-card sync** — bring this tenant's charged ``VirtualCard`` rows
     (status ``charged`` / ``completed`` with a recorded ``amount_charged``)
     into the card-transaction feed as ``CorporateCardTransaction`` rows so
     virtual-card spend reconciles through the same surface. Idempotent via a
     synthetic ``external_txn_id`` (``vc:<provider_card_id>``) and the
     partial-unique index ``uq_corporate_card_txn_external``.

The actual side-effecting link/unlink (both-sides FK + ``payment_method``) lives
in the router so it can audit each side; this module is the read/derive layer.
