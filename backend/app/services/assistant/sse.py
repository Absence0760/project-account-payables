"""Server-sent-events framing for the conversational assistant stream.

Pure, DB-free helpers that turn the orchestrator's in-memory turn artifacts
(``ToolInvocation``, the assembled answer, the usage delta) into SSE frames on
the exact wire contract the frontend builds against. Keeping the framing here
(not in the orchestrator or the route) means the event shapes are unit-testable
without a DB and can't drift between the two.

Each frame is standard SSE: a ``event: <name>`` line, a ``data: <single-line
JSON>`` line, then a blank line. The JSON is emitted with ``ensure_ascii`` and
no embedded newlines so a single ``data:`` line always carries one whole event.

Event protocol (names + data shapes):
  - ``tool``  → ``{"tool", "args", "result"|null, "error"|null}`` — one per
    invocation, before the prose, so the UI can chart while text streams.
  - ``delta`` → ``{"text": "<chunk>"}`` — incremental answer text.
  - ``done``  → ``{"conversation_id", "answer", "tool_invocations": [...],
    "usage": {"input_tokens", "output_tokens"}}`` — final authoritative payload.
  - ``error`` → ``{"code", "detail"}`` — only for failures AFTER the stream
    started (a pre-stream budget refusal is a real HTTP 429, not an in-stream
    error).
