"""Pydantic param + return models for the five fixed assistant tools.

Money is always ``Decimal`` (never ``float``); on transport each ReturnModel is
dumped with ``model_dump(mode="json")``, which serialises ``Decimal`` to a
string — never a lossy float. Param models clamp limits so a leaked/odd model
arg can't request an unbounded scan.
