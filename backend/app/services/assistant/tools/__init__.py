"""Fixed assistant toolset — registry, Anthropic specs, dispatch.

Five typed read-only tools over the **current tenant** only. Each ``ToolSpec``
binds a name to its param/return Pydantic models, the async tool fn, and the
Anthropic tool schema (auto-derived from the param model's JSON schema). The
orchestrator runs the fn; the model can only emit one of these five calls with
typed, clamped params — never raw SQL.
