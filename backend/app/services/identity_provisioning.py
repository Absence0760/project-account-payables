"""Provider-neutral identity provisioning shared by every SSO protocol.

Both the OIDC callback (`api/auth_sso.py`) and the SAML ACS
(`api/auth_saml.py`) land here once they have a verified
`(provider, subject, email)` tuple from the IdP. Keeping JIT provisioning
and the email-domain allowlist in one place means the two protocols share
the exact same user-matching, role-defaulting, and SSO-linking semantics —
the protocol-specific code only differs in how it *verifies* the IdP
response, never in how it maps that response onto a `User`.

    person for a while (a stale session, a directory that hasn't converged, or
    an app-level deactivation the IdP never learns about), so the SSO callback
    is the place that has to say no.

    Without this, both SSO callbacks happily minted an access token for a

    was tracked, and an `auth.sso.login.success` / `auth.saml.login.success`
    row landed in the SOX trail for someone who no longer has access. The

    A matched-but-DEACTIVATED account raises `DeactivatedAccount` rather than

    sso_provider_id), so a tenant that switches a user from OIDC
    (provider="okta"/"entra") to SAML (provider="saml", subject=NameID)
    won't match on step 1 the first time — it falls to the email-link
