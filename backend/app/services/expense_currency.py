"""Expense-report currency conversion — locked FX, never a naive cross-currency sum.

An employee on one trip legitimately incurs expenses in several currencies, so a
report is **not** constrained to a single currency. Instead every line is
converted, and the conversion is **locked** — exactly the convention the invoice
path already uses (``services/currency_conversion.materialize_reporting_amount``
→ ``invoices.reporting_*``) and the payment path uses
(``services/international_payments`` → ``payments.fx_rate`` / ``fx_locked_at``).
A locked rate is persisted on the row and read back verbatim; it is **never**
re-fetched at read time, so a report's total cannot drift with the market
between submission and approval.

Two layers, deliberately named apart because their target currencies differ:

===========================  ===============================  ==========================
Layer                        Columns                          Target currency
===========================  ===============================  ==========================
Line → report                ``expenses.converted_*``         ``ExpenseReport.currency``
Report → org reporting base  ``expense_reports.reporting_*``  ``resolve_reporting_currency``
===========================  ===============================  ==========================

The first makes ``ExpenseReport.total_amount`` a well-defined figure in the
report's own currency. The second makes the CFO-threshold gate non-manipulable:
the threshold (``settings.expense_approval.cfo_threshold``) is a bare number
denominated in the org's reporting currency, so a report filed in a foreign
currency has to be expressed in that currency before it can be compared —
otherwise a 4 900 EUR report would slip under a 5 000 USD threshold.

Fail-closed, both ways:

* A foreign-currency line that cannot be converted is **excluded** from the
  total and counted in ``unconverted_count``; the report cannot be submitted
  while any such line is attached. It is never silently summed at face value
  (that was the bug — issue #157).
* A report whose reporting-currency figure is unavailable is treated by the gate
  as *over* the threshold (CFO sign-off required), never under it.
* A policy threshold that cannot be compared against the expense's amount (the
  two are in different currencies and nothing on the row bridges them) is
  treated by ``services/expense_policy`` as *breached* — a required receipt is
  demanded rather than waived. See ``expense_amount_in_currency`` below.

Money is ``Decimal`` end to end, quantized to 2 dp ``ROUND_HALF_UP``; rates to
8 dp. Never ``float``.
