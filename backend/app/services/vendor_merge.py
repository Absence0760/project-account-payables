"""Vendor consolidation — the **execute** (apply) path.

The sibling ``app.services.vendor_consolidation`` is *advisory*: it clusters
likely-duplicate vendors and suggests a canonical pick, but never mutates
anything. This module is the explicit, steward-invoked **merge**: fold a set of
duplicate vendors into one canonical vendor so the master list deduplicates and
nothing is left pointing at a retired vendor.

What a merge does, in one tenant transaction:

  1. Row-lock the canonical + every duplicate vendor (``SELECT … FOR UPDATE``)
     so two concurrent merges can't interleave the FK reassignment.
  2. Reassign **every** ``vendor_id`` FK on every tenant child table from each
     duplicate → the canonical vendor (one bounded ``UPDATE`` per child table).
     The full child-table set is ``VENDOR_FK_CHILDREN`` below — if a new table
     gains a ``vendor_id`` FK, it MUST be added there or its rows orphan on a
     merge.
  3. Collapse the ``vendor_extraction_priors`` of the canonical + every
     duplicate so at most ONE prior per ``field_name`` reaches the canonical
     (the table is uniquely keyed on ``(vendor_id, field_name)``, so both a
     canonical/duplicate and a duplicate/duplicate clash would otherwise blow
     up the merge with an ``IntegrityError``). See ``_prior_precedence``.
  4. Mark each merged duplicate ``status="inactive"`` (a soft retire — we never
     hard-delete a vendor, so the historical row + its audit trail survive).

The operation is:

  * **Idempotent** — a re-run with the duplicates already inactive and their
    FKs already moved reassigns zero rows and re-deactivates nothing; it returns
    the same shape with ``reassigned`` counts of 0, never an error.
  * **Tenant + entity scoped** — every vendor is resolved inside the caller's
    tenant DB; the canonical and all duplicates must share the SAME
    ``entity_id`` (a cross-entity merge is refused). FK reassignment is keyed by
    ``vendor_id`` (each child row already lives in the same tenant DB).
  * **PII-free auditable** — the caller writes a ``vendor.merged`` audit row
    carrying the canonical id, the duplicate ids, and the per-table reassigned
    counts. No ``tax_id`` / bank / address ever enters the result or a log.

Refusals (raised as ``VendorMergeError`` → mapped to 4xx by the API layer):
  * canonical id appears in the duplicate set (self-merge),
  * an empty duplicate set,
  * a vendor id that doesn't resolve in the tenant (unknown → opaque to the
    caller via the API's 404),
  * canonical and a duplicate live in different entities (cross-entity).
