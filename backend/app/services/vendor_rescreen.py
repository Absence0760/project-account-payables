"""Periodic vendor re-screening sweep — background loop ("ongoing monitoring").

Sanctions lists move. A vendor that screened ``clear`` at onboarding can land
on a watchlist months later, so a one-time screen is not enough — the roadmap
"ongoing monitoring" item re-screens active vendors on a cadence and re-blocks
any that newly hit. Every tick:

  1. Enumerate tenant DBs from the control plane (one query, also pulls each
     org's ``settings`` so we have the adapter config per tenant).
  2. For each tenant, open a fresh per-tenant engine and select ``active``
     vendors whose ``last_screened_at`` is NULL or older than the staleness
     window (``settings.vendor_rescreen_after_days``).
  3. Re-screen each via ``vendor_screening.screen_vendor_record``
     (``check_type="periodic"``) — the trail row, denormalised state, and the
     payment block are all handled there.
  4. Track how many vendors NEWLY flip to ``match`` / ``review`` (a vendor that
     was previously neither) and log an INFO line per new flag so the AP team
     can monitor. (No notification event-type exists for vendor screening and
     inventing one would need a migration / event-registry change; the re-screen
     itself — including the payment block on a ``match`` — is the load-bearing
     behaviour, so we deliberately fall back to logging here.)
  5. Commit **per vendor**.

Mirrors ``services/contract_renewal.py``: long-lived asyncio task started in
``main.lifespan``, fresh per-tenant engine, one tenant's failure logged but
never halting the sweep. Disabled by default (``FEOH_VENDOR_RESCREEN_ENABLED``).

**Why per-vendor and not once per tenant.** The tenant loop had no per-vendor
guard and committed once at the end, and ``screen_vendor_record`` has no
internal ``except`` — so a single vendor whose screen raised (adapter transport
error, a bad credential, one malformed row) aborted the tenant's whole sweep
*before* that commit. Not even the vendors already screened on that tick got
their ``last_screened_at`` advanced, so every one of them stayed due, the same
poison vendor was re-selected on the next tick, and the sweep made **zero
progress forever** — a sanctions-compliance control silently not running, whose
only trace was a per-tenant ``failures`` counter the loop discards. Committing
each vendor on its own turns that into: the poison vendor is skipped and
counted, everyone else advances. Each vendor is re-read by id inside its own
leg, because a rollback expires the ORM objects a pre-loaded list would still be
holding — and touching one of those from async SQLAlchemy is a
``MissingGreenlet``, not a clean failure.
