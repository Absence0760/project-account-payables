"""QMS sync — pull external quality inspections into ``quality_inspections``.

Two entry points:

  * :func:`sync_tenant_inspections` — one tenant, one sweep. Fetches records
    from the configured QMS adapter, resolves each record's ``po_number`` /
    ``gr_number`` to local ``PurchaseOrder`` / ``GoodsReceipt`` ids, then
    UPSERTS a :class:`~app.models.quality_inspection.QualityInspection`
    idempotently keyed on ``(organization_id, inspection_number)``. Writes an
    append-only ``quality_inspection.synced`` audit row per record that
    genuinely landed or changed. The caller owns the transaction (commits) —
    same contract as the inspections router, which runs inside
    ``get_tenant_db``'s commit/rollback wrapper.

  * :func:`run_qms_sync_loop` — the background sweep. Enumerates every tenant
    DB from the control plane and runs :func:`sync_tenant_inspections` for each
    org that has a QMS configured. Mirrors ``contract_renewal.run_renewal_loop``:
    long-lived asyncio task started in ``main.lifespan``, fresh per-tenant
    engine, one tenant's failure logged but never halting the sweep. Disabled
    by default (``FEOH_QMS_SYNC_ENABLED``).

Idempotency: the upsert key is ``(organization_id, inspection_number)``. A
re-run updates the existing row's result / quantities / notes / dates in place
rather than inserting a duplicate — exactly the ``status``-guard role the other
sweeps rely on, but here it's a natural-key lookup. ``inspector`` and the QMS
record carry no PII we log (the audit ``details`` records the inspection number
and resolution outcome only).

Two properties keep that idempotent re-run from being unboundedly expensive:

  * **The pull is incremental.** ``since`` — declared by the adapter contract
    from the start, and previously accepted by
    :func:`run_qms_sync_once` and then dropped on the floor — is threaded all
    the way to ``adapter.fetch_inspections``. The per-org high-water mark lives
    in the settings JSON (:func:`resolve_qms_sync_cursor` /
    :func:`store_qms_sync_cursor`), the house pattern for per-org platform
    state. Without it every hourly tick re-fetched each tenant's entire
    inspection history.
  * **An audit row marks a real change.** The ``quality_inspection.synced``
    write is gated on an actual create-or-update (:func:`_apply_record`). It was
    unconditional, with ``change`` reading ``"updated"`` even when nothing had
    moved, so each tick appended ``len(records)`` rows to ``audit_log`` — a
    table migration 0022's BEFORE-DELETE trigger makes undeletable and the audit
    shipper has to drain to a WORM store. Unbounded growth, describing nothing.
