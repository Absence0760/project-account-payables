"""Projected cash-shortfall alerts — background sweep that pushes the cash
forecast instead of waiting for someone to pull it.

The cash-position curve (opening balance carried forward minus scheduled AP
outflows) and the breach detector it feeds already ship and are already exact
— but until now the only way to learn that a period closes below the org's
minimum balance was to open `/cfo` or ask the copilot. A cash shortfall you
find out about by looking is one you find out about late; this sweep tells the
finance leaders as soon as the forecast says it.

Every tick:

  1. Enumerate orgs from the control plane.
  2. Skip any org with no persisted ``settings.cashflow.min_balance_threshold``
     — the threshold IS the opt-in. Without one there is no line to breach and
     nothing to say.
  3. Build the org-wide commitment rows (the SAME ``_commitment_rows`` the CFO
     dashboard and the copilot use), bucket them weekly over the configured
     horizon, resolve the opening balance through the shared
     ``services.cashflow.resolve_opening_balance`` (so an alert can never start
     from a different number than the copilot's answer), and run the pure
     ``detect_threshold_breaches``.
  4. If the EARLIEST breaching period differs from the one this org was last
     alerted about, notify the finance leaders once
     (``notification_dispatch.notify_event``, in-app + email, preference-gated)
     and record the period on ``Organization.settings.cashflow.shortfall_alert``.
     When the projection clears, the marker is cleared too, so the alert
     re-arms and a shortfall that comes back is announced again.

Money-path boundary (important)
-------------------------------
This sweep only READS the forecast and sends a notification. It creates no
``Payment`` / ``PaymentRun``, accepts no discount, and touches no invoice —
exactly like ``discount_auto_trigger`` never funds and ``recurring_invoices``
never pays. Its single write outside the notification rows is the
alerted-period marker in the org's settings JSON.

Scope
-----
Deliberately org-wide (``entity_id=None``): a treasury shortfall is a question
about the whole legal group's cash, not one subsidiary's slice — the same
consolidated posture ``GET /api/analytics/by-entity`` takes by ignoring
``X-Entity-ID``.

Idempotency
-----------
The alerted-period marker is the dedupe (the role ``renewal_alert_sent_at``
plays in ``contract_renewal`` and the ``offered`` status guard plays in
``discount_auto_trigger``). The notification is sent BEFORE the marker is
written, so a crash in between re-alerts on the next tick rather than silently
swallowing the warning — for an alert, a duplicate is the safe failure
direction and a miss is not.

Mirrors the ``contract_renewal`` pattern: long-lived asyncio task started in
``main.lifespan``, fresh per-tenant engine, one tenant's failure logged (class
only, never a message that could carry data) but never halting the sweep.
Disabled by default (``FEOH_CASHFLOW_SHORTFALL_ALERTS_ENABLED``).
