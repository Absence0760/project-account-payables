"""Budget spend-rollup logic — computed on read (no stored running total).

A ``Budget`` row carries only the *allocation* (``amount``). Everything that
has been spent or committed against it is derived live from the procurement +
AP tables, so the numbers never drift out of sync with the underlying activity.

Money is exact end-to-end: every aggregate is a Postgres ``SUM`` over a
``Numeric(15, 2)`` column coerced to ``Decimal`` (never float). The API layer
serialises the resulting ``Decimal`` to ``float`` for display only — mirroring
the expense-reporting rollup (``api/expenses.py::report_summary``).

Spend definitions (the contract the ``/spend`` + ``/check`` endpoints expose):

  allocated  — ``budget.amount``. The cap for this dimension/period.

  committed  — money that is earmarked but not yet invoiced. Two legs, summed:
                 1. ``PurchaseRequisition.total`` for requisitions linked to the
                    budget (``budget_id == budget.id``) whose status is one of
                    the OPEN-COMMITMENT statuses — ``submitted``,
                    ``pending_approval``, ``approved`` — i.e. live demand that
                    has NOT yet become a PO.
                 2. ``PurchaseOrder.total`` for the POs those budget-linked
                    requisitions converted into (``status == 'converted'`` reqs,
                    joined to ``purchase_orders`` via ``converted_po_id``),
                    excluding cancelled/closed POs.
               A converted requisition's amount is represented by its PO (leg 2),
               NOT by the requisition (leg 1) — the OPEN-COMMITMENT status list
               deliberately omits ``converted`` so the two legs never
               double-count the same demand.

  actual     — money already invoiced against this budget's dimension. Invoices
               do not carry a ``budget_id``, so they are attributed by matching
               the budget's ``dimension`` to the corresponding ``Invoice``
               column — one column per dimension, all four covered:
                 - ``cost_center``  → ``Invoice.cost_center == dimension_value``
                 - ``gl_account``   → ``Invoice.gl_account  == dimension_value``
                 - ``department``   → ``Invoice.department  == dimension_value``
                 - ``project``      → ``Invoice.project     == dimension_value``
               Only invoices in a REALISED-SPEND status count — ``approved``,
               ``payment_scheduled``, ``paid``, ``posted_in_erp``, ``sent_to_erp``,
               ``done`` — so a brand-new / rejected invoice never inflates actual.
               When the budget carries both ``period_start`` and ``period_end``,
               actual is further bounded to invoices whose ``invoice_date`` falls
               inside that window, so two budgets tracking the same dimension in
               different periods don't both report all-time spend.

  remaining  — ``allocated - committed - actual`` (can go negative = overspend).

  utilization — ``(committed + actual) / allocated`` as a percentage, rounded to
               2 dp. ``0`` when allocated is 0 (avoid div-by-zero).

The **actual** (invoice) leg is scoped to the budget's own entity (the rule
``tenant.apply_entity_scope`` applies, written correlated against
``Budget.entity_id``) so a subsidiary's budget never picks up a sibling
subsidiary's spend on a shared free-text dimension value.
The two **committed** legs are NOT: they key off
``PurchaseRequisition.budget_id``, an unambiguous human-declared link, so an
entity filter there could only drop deliberately-linked demand — see the note
above ``_committed_requisition_total``.

Every leg is scoped to the budget's own ``currency`` — the legs never convert,
so mixing currencies would add unlike face values (a EUR and a USD invoice on
the same cost center are NOT summed).

**One implementation, two scopes.** Each leg is a GROUPED query keyed on
``Budget.id``, so a whole set of budgets costs a bounded number of round trips
rather than three per budget. ``compute_budget_spend`` (what
``GET /budgets/{id}/spend`` and ``/budgets/check`` read) is that same query with
a single-budget filter — deliberately not a second SQL shape, because the two
carry an ``excluded_row_count`` disclosure that is worse than useless if the
org-wide view and the per-budget view can disagree about it.
