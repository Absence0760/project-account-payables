"""Vendor ERP sync service — pull vendors from ERP and sync to local database.

Every vendor row this creates or changes writes an append-only audit row
(``vendor.synced_from_erp``), the same way ``services/qms_sync`` audits each
inspection it upserts. A vendor is a PAYEE: a bulk ERP pull that silently
materialised new payee rows was the one vendor-mutating path with no record of
where the row came from or who ran the pull. Rows the sync leaves byte-identical
(``unchanged``) write nothing — an audit row for a state change that did not
happen is unbounded growth describing nothing.
