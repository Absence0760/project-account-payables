"""Sanctions-screening category taxonomy — the persisted half.

``ScreeningResult.categories`` (see ``sanctions_adapters/base.py``) enumerates
the *kinds* of hit a provider reported: a hard sanctions-list match, a PEP
flag, a high-risk jurisdiction, or an **adverse-media** (negative-news) hit —
press coverage of fraud / corruption that has not reached a formal list.

The adapters produce that taxonomy; this module is how it survives the write
and reaches the three surfaces that act on it:

* ``compliance.check_payment_compliance`` — an adverse-media hit adds its own
  reason to the ``ComplianceDecision``, so the AP team reviewing the hold sees
  *why* rather than a bare ``review_required``.
* ``vendor_screening.screen_vendor_record`` — the labels ride the persisted
  ``sanctions_checks`` row and the PII-free ``vendor.screened`` audit row.
* ``vendor_risk_scoring`` — reads them back off the persisted row (it is
  compute-on-read and never calls an adapter) to raise the vendor's sanctions
  sub-score and name the signal in ``Vendor.risk_factors``.

**Why the row's JSONB and not a new column.** ``sanctions_checks.raw_response``
and ``vendors.risk_factors`` are both already JSONB, so no migration is needed
to carry a taxonomy that is small, additive, and read by exactly one query
pattern (the latest row per vendor). A dedicated column would fan a schema
change out to every tenant DB to store what is effectively an enum list.

**The labels are PII-free by construction.** They are a fixed vocabulary — no
provider free text, no names, no dates of birth. That is what makes them safe
to put in an audit row, an API response and a UI badge, while
``raw_response``'s provider payload stays confined to the JSONB column
(invariant #7).
