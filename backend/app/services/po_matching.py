    site, the same way ``vendor_matching.match_and_link_vendor`` does it. Two
    subsidiaries that each number their POs from ``PO-1001`` and share a supplier
    would otherwise cross-match: the ``created_at DESC LIMIT 1`` pick could return
    the OTHER entity's newer ``PO-1001`` and read ``matched``, silently passing the
    amount control against a different subsidiary's order. Scoping is STRICT (no
    ``include_shared``) — unlike a vendor or a GL account, a purchase order belongs
    to exactly one entity; an invoice with a NULL ``entity_id`` (unstamped /
