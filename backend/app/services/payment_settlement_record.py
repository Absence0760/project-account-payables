"""Recording a settlement against a payment — the DB-touching half.

`services/payment_settlement.py` is pure: it decides a verdict and says what
`payments.settled_amount` can hold. This module is what WRITES that verdict —
fetching a missing figure from the processor, persisting the settled columns,
and raising the payment-blocking exception a discrepancy warrants.

It exists because there are **two** paths on which a payment reaches
`completed`, and they had drifted. `payment_webhook` verified the settlement,
put the verdict on the append-only audit row and opened a `fraud_flag` on a
mismatch. The reconciler backstop — the path that runs precisely when the
webhook never arrived, i.e. the case with the LEAST evidence — persisted the
figure and stopped there: no verdict, no audit block, no exception. A rail
reporting a 10x overpayment settled silently and `settlement_coverage` marked
the invoice `paid`, because over-settlement is `covered` by design. A short
settlement stranded the invoice at `payment_scheduled` with nothing in the
queue to explain it. And because the webhook handler refuses a payment that is
already terminal, a late webhook could never supply the missing verdict.

One implementation, both callers, so the two cannot disagree about what
"verified" means.

The same drift reappeared one field over. Realized FX gain/loss — the number a
foreign-currency invoice books at the moment it actually settles — was computed
inline in the webhook handler and nowhere else, so every cross-currency payment
the reconciler backstop recovered lost its realized-FX row silently. Rather
than copy the block, :func:`record_completion` now owns the WHOLE "a payment
just reached ``completed``" bookkeeping — settlement verdict AND realized FX —
and both paths call it. A third completion path cannot reintroduce the gap
without deliberately re-deriving what this module already returns;
``tests/test_payment_completion_record.py`` is the drift guard on that.
