"""Bulk GL re-coding service.

Re-applies GL codes to a scoped set of invoices using two strategies:

  1. **Vendor priors** (free, fast, idempotent) — looks up the cached
     `gl_account` correction for each invoice's vendor. Applies it
     when it validates against the active chart.

  2. **AI fallback** (billed, opt-in) — for invoices with no usable
     prior, re-fetches the file from S3 and runs the configured
     extraction adapter end-to-end. Used only when the caller opts
     in via `include_ai_fallback=True`.

The AI fallback path produces an `ExtractionUsage` row on the control-
plane DB for every invoice it touches, identical to the regular
extraction flow (see `services.extraction`). Audit log entries are
written for each persisted change so the activity is traceable in the
invoice's history.

Eligibility
-----------
Invoices in `IMMUTABLE_STATUSES` (sending_to_erp through paid) are
excluded — once an invoice has left the AP team's hands, re-coding it
would create reconciliation drift with the ERP.
