"""Email-to-invoice intake.

Receives forwarded-PDF invoices from a per-tenant inbound email address
(e.g. ``invoices+a1b2c3d4@ap.feohledger.com``) and routes each
attachment through the normal extraction pipeline. The AP team tells
their vendors "send POs to this address" and the invoice appears in the
queue without anyone touching the UI.

Public API:
    - ``provision_intake_token(org)`` — generate+persist a token on the org
    - ``resolve_tenant_from_recipient(ctrl_db, to_address)`` — reverse-lookup
    - ``process_inbound_email(ctrl_db, payload)`` — the webhook entry point

The webhook endpoint is provider-agnostic. We accept a normalized
:class:`InboundEmail` payload; provider-specific parsers live in
``services/email_intake_adapters/`` (SES SNS JSON, Mailgun form-data, etc).
This keeps the core intake logic testable and the provider plumbing
isolated.

Security:
    - Token in the recipient address is the tenant bearer — treat it like
      a password (constant-time compare against the stored token).
      Leaked token = spam channel into that tenant's AP queue. Which is why
      the recipient address never reaches a log line: a live token lands in
      the unresolved branch every time an org toggles intake off, and the
      address is a third party's PII besides. The miss is logged by shape
      (was a ``+token`` present at all), not by value.
    - HMAC-SHA256 signature verification against
      ``settings.email_intake_signing_secret`` when the header is present.
    - Dedup by the provider's ``message_id`` (shared
      ``webhook_security.is_event_already_processed`` Redis guard) before
      any Invoice is created — a provider retry or duplicate delivery of
      the same message must not create a second invoice. If invoice
      creation then fails downstream (e.g. S3/tenant-DB outage), the claim
      is released via ``release_event_claim`` so the next redelivery can
      retry instead of the message being silently dropped for the TTL
      window (mirrors ``api/cards.py``'s webhook claim/release discipline).
    - We silently drop attachments that are not PDFs / images (avoid
      shipping .docx Trojans into the extraction pipeline).
    - Rate-limiting is the provider's job — point SES at a Lambda that
      drops duplicates before they reach us, or use Mailgun's built-in
      rate limits.
