"""Periodic access reviews — flag users holding unused elevated permissions (SOX).

A SOX access-control requirement is to *review* who holds privileged access and
prove that access is still used. This service is the read side of that review:
it lists every user in the org who holds an elevated role **or an elevated
granular permission** and, for each, derives their "last privileged action"
from the tenant ``audit_log`` (the append-only, WORM-shipped trail every
mutation already writes). A user whose last privileged action is older than the
dormancy window — or who has never acted — is flagged DORMANT so a reviewer can
decide whether to revoke the access.

"Elevated" is not just the three system role names (``admin`` / ``ap_manager``
/ ``cfo``): a custom role (`app/api/permissions.py`) can grant a fraud-sensitive
permission like ``payment.execute`` to a role named anything at all, and that
user must be just as visible to this review — see ``ELEVATED_PERMISSIONS``.

Compute-on-read: there is **no** ``last_elevated_use`` column and no migration.
The index is derived live by aggregating ``MAX(audit_log.created_at)`` per actor.
This keeps the trail itself the single source of truth (it can't drift from a
denormalised column) and inherits the audit table's immutability for free.

Pure-ish + deterministic: the only inputs are the two DB sessions and "now".
No LLM, no network. The HTTP route (``app/api/access_reviews.py``) owns the
sensitive-read audit row and the RBAC gate.

Scope of "privileged action": we count *mutating* audit rows only — a
``*.viewed`` row means the user merely looked at a record, which is not evidence
that their elevated *write* permission is still needed. So a CFO who only ever
opens the dashboard (all ``*.viewed`` reads) is correctly surfaced as dormant
for their elevated mutate rights. Read rows are excluded by dropping any action
ending in ``.viewed`` / ``.exported`` (both are access-log verbs, not mutations).
