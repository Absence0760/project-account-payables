"""Retention-policy enforcement sweep (SOX records management).

Configurable retention periods per record class are stored on
``Organization.settings.retention`` (e.g. ``{"invoices_months": 84,
"audit_log_months": 84}``) — NOT hardcoded. This sweep finds records past their
retention window and ARCHIVES them through a privileged, AUDITED path, writing a
``retention.archived`` audit row per batch.

CRITICAL — it composes with the audit-immutability trigger (migration 0022):
``audit_log`` rows can NOT be deleted (the BEFORE-DELETE trigger rejects every
DELETE). So this sweep NEVER deletes audit rows. For the ``audit_log`` class,
"retention" means *verifying* that rows past the window have been WORM-shipped
(``shipped_at`` set) and recording a retention manifest (counts) in the audit
trail — never deletion. Unshipped-but-overdue rows are surfaced in the manifest
so an operator knows the WORM sink is behind. The manifest is written only when
the tick has something ACTIONABLE to record — invoices archived, or overdue rows
the WORM sink has not taken — never merely because overdue audit rows exist,
which is permanently true once a tenant crosses its window (see the gate's
comment in :func:`sweep_tenant`).

For deletable business records we soft-archive terminal-state invoices: an
``invoices`` row in a terminal state (``done`` / ``paid``) whose age exceeds the
``invoices_months`` window gets an ``archived_at`` marker stamped into its
``meta`` JSONB bag. No row is destroyed and no schema change is needed — the
marker is the privileged archival action, fully reversible, and the sweep is
idempotent (already-marked rows are excluded in SQL, so a re-run never
double-archives and never re-reads the archive). Each tick archives at most
``FEOH_RETENTION_BATCH_SIZE`` invoices per tenant, oldest first, so a large
backlog drains over several ticks instead of one unbounded one; the manifest
records only counts, never the archived ids.

Mirrors ``contract_renewal`` / ``qms_sync``: a long-lived asyncio loop started
in ``main.lifespan``, fresh per-tenant engine, one tenant's failure logged but
never halting the sweep. Disabled by default (``FEOH_RETENTION_ENABLED``).
