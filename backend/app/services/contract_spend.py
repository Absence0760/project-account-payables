"""Spend-to-contract rollup.

Aggregates the invoices linked to a contract (``Invoice.contract_id``) into a
spend summary: invoiced total, count, and how that sits against the contract's
``spend_limit``. Money stays exact — the sum runs in the DB over the
``Numeric`` ``amount`` column and is handled as ``Decimal`` here; only the API
response coerces to float (matching every other money field on the wire).

Rejected invoices are excluded — a rejected bill never became real spend. The
sum is also scoped to the contract's own ``currency`` — same as
``budget_service``'s rollups, the legs never convert, so mixing currencies
would add unlike face values and could misreport ``over_limit``.
