    **Entity scoping.** ``vendors`` carries a nullable ``entity_id``
    (``EntityMixin``), so in a multi-entity tenant an unscoped lookup can hand
    an invoice a vendor belonging to a *different* subsidiary. When the caller
    supplies the invoice's entity, candidates are narrowed to that entity **∪
    rows whose ``entity_id`` is NULL**.

    A NULL means something different here than it does on ``gl_accounts``,
    where it is a deliberate "shared chart" marker. On ``vendors`` it means the
    row was never stamped with a subsidiary: a pre-multi-entity row that
    migration ``0029``'s backfill didn't reach, or one auto-created from an
    invoice that itself carried no entity. It must nonetheless stay matchable
    from every entity — a supplier is a real-world counterparty, not
    subsidiary-private data, and dropping unstamped rows from the candidate set
    would not fail loudly: it would silently mint a *duplicate* vendor,
    splitting the supplier's spend rollup and giving it a second, independently
    editable bank-detail record. Under-matching here is the more dangerous
    failure, so NULL is admitted.

    ``entity_id is None`` (an unstamped invoice, or a caller with no entity in
    hand) is a passthrough — exactly the pre-multi-entity behaviour, which is
    also what every single-entity tenant sees, since there all vendors are
    either under the one default entity or NULL.

    The ordering makes the pick deterministic and prefers the caller's own
    subsidiary over an unstamped row when both could match.
