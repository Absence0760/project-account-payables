    **Why this exists.** ``dispatch_auth_audit`` resolves the tenant DB from the
    control plane and commits a row inline — a whole DB round trip on the
    caller's path. On ``/auth/login`` that round trip only happens when the
    submitted address *has* an organization, so a known address (wrong
    password, no password, deactivated) was measurably slower than an unknown
    one: an account-existence oracle around the very bcrypt cost
    ``dummy_verify`` exists to equalize. Dropping the row is worse than the
    leak, and padding the fast path is masking; moving the write off the
    response path is the fix that costs neither branch anything.

    **Why not** :mod:`app.services.post_commit`. That queue fires from
    SQLAlchemy's ``after_commit``. A failed login raises ``HTTPException``, so
    ``get_control_db`` rolls its session back — ``after_rollback`` drains and
    DISCARDS the queue by design ("do not tell anyone about a change that never
    happened"). A row queued there would never be written. The trigger here is
    therefore the event loop itself: the write is spawned as a task and runs
    while the response is already on its way out.

    ``organization_id`` may be ``None`` — the tenant DB is resolved from it, so
    there is nowhere to write and the row is dropped (visibly, at INFO). Taking
    ``None`` rather than making the caller branch is the point: both login
    failure branches call this unconditionally, so they stay structurally
    identical.
