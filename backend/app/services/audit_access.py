"""Access-control auditing + field-level change history (SOX).

Two thin helpers layered on the existing ``dispatch_audit`` pipeline — they do
NOT reimplement it. Both write through ``dispatch_audit`` so view-events and
field diffs land in the same tenant ``audit_log`` → WORM-shipper trail as every
other audit row.

``log_access`` records *who VIEWED what* — the SOX access-control requirement
(log reads of regulated records, not just writes). The detail payload records
the entity id and the **field-names** accessed, never the values: no tax id,
bank number, or PAN ever enters ``audit_log.details`` (PII-out-of-logs
invariant).

``build_field_diff`` produces the structured before/after shape persisted on
mutation rows: ``{"field": {"old": ..., "new": ...}}``. Money values are
serialised as **string-Decimal** (never float) so the "money is exact"
invariant holds inside the JSONB too.
