"""Deliver a webhook: sign, POST, classify, retry with backoff, dead-letter.

A delivery is attempted up to ``MAX_ATTEMPTS`` times. Each failed attempt
schedules the next via exponential backoff (``BACKOFF_BASE_SECONDS * 2**(n-1)``);
once attempts are exhausted the row moves to the ``dead`` state (dead-letter) and
is never retried automatically — only an explicit redelivery (the management API)
re-queues it.

Local-first: delivery is a plain ``httpx`` POST in-process. No cloud queue is
required. The immediate attempt fires from ``dispatch.emit_event`` on the running
loop; ``run_webhook_delivery_loop`` is the durable retry backstop, gated behind
``FEOH_WEBHOOKS_ENABLED`` (OFF by default in local dev).

Because those two paths overlap in time (emit commits the row due-now, THEN
spawns the immediate attempt), a delivery is **claimed** before it is sent:
every load that is about to POST takes the row ``FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED``, so a
row already in flight elsewhere is skipped rather than POSTed twice, and
``attempt_count`` is a serialized read-modify-write. Without the claim the retry
budget was ``MAX_ATTEMPTS`` per *worker*, not per delivery.

PII discipline: the payloads themselves carry only invoice metadata (no bank /
tax / PAN fields — built in ``dispatch.py``), and the logs here record the
delivery id + status code + event type only, never the target URL's query string
or the response body.
