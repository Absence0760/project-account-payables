"""SSRF guard for outbound-webhook target URLs.

A tenant admin supplies ``target_url`` freely; without a destination check they
could point a subscription at loopback / RFC1918 / link-local (including the
AWS IMDS at 169.254.169.254) and the delivery loop would POST signed
invoice/payment payloads there. This module is the single shared validator,
enforced at BOTH boundaries:

* subscription create/update (``api/webhooks.py``) — reject early with a clean,
  non-enumerating 422, and
* immediately before every dispatch (``services/webhooks/delivery.py``) — the
  stored host is RE-resolved at send time, so a DNS record that flipped to a
  private address after create (TOCTOU / DNS rebinding) is refused and the
  delivery is marked failed.

Every address the host resolves to (A and AAAA) must be publicly routable; a
literal-IP host is judged the same way, and IPv4-mapped IPv6
(``::ffff:10.0.0.1``) is unwrapped and judged as its embedded IPv4 address.
Fail-closed: a host that does not resolve is rejected too.

Residual risk: the actual connection is opened by ``httpx``, which performs its
own lookup — a narrow rebinding window remains between this check and the
socket connect. Pinning the checked IP for the connection would close it;
re-resolving immediately before send is the accepted fix per issue #171. See
``backend/docs/public-api.md`` § Outbound webhooks.

Dev escape hatch: ``AP_WEBHOOKS_ALLOW_PRIVATE_TARGETS=true`` skips only the
address checks (URL scheme/host shape is still enforced) so the delivery path
can be exercised locally against 127.0.0.1. Defaults to ``false`` (blocking);
never enable it in a deployed env.
