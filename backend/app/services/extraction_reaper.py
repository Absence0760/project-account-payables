"""Reaper for invoices stuck in `pending` extraction.

When extraction never completes — Ollama hung, worker crashed, an upload
landed without a file_key — the invoice sits in `pending` forever, taking
up a slot in the reviewer's queue and confusing the user. This service
sweeps every tenant DB on a timer and transitions any `pending` invoice
older than `FEOH_EXTRACTION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` to `failed`. The reviewer can
then re-trigger extraction or fall back to manual entry.

Pure async — runs as a long-lived asyncio task started in `main.lifespan`.
Cancelling the task (server shutdown) is handled cleanly.

Also exposed as a CLI: `python scripts/reap_stuck_extractions.py`.

    """Transition stuck `pending` invoices in one tenant DB to `failed`.

    Returns ``(reaped, failed_rows)``.

    Uses a fresh engine per call — same pattern as `extraction_dispatch._run_local`.
    The reaper runs in the FastAPI event loop, but tenant engines aren't
    cached for it; cheaper to spin one up than to plumb through the cache.

    **Two-phase, one row locked at a time**, the shape every mutating sweep
    uses (see `../docs/background-sweeps.md` § Locking): candidate ids are read
    UNLOCKED, then each is re-read `FOR UPDATE`, re-checked against the
    predicate the id query used, transitioned, and committed on its own — which
    releases the lock before the next row is touched.

    The re-check is the load-bearing part, not an optimisation. The sweep used
    to load whole `Invoice` objects up front and transition them from that
    snapshot, so an extraction that finished DURING the tick was silently
    overwritten: `transition_invoice` validates against the STALE in-memory
    `pending`, `pending → failed` is a legal edge, and the UPDATE then stamped
    `failed` over the row's real, freshly-committed state. An invoice that had
    reached `ready_for_review` (or `approved` — `pending → approved` is legal
    too) came out `failed`, carrying an `extraction_timeout` warning about an
    extraction that had actually succeeded, and with no way back:
    `failed → ready_for_review` is not a legal edge, so the reviewer has to
    re-run extraction to recover a document that was already done. Re-reading
    under the lock means such a row is simply skipped.

    Committing per row also stops one invoice's failure from discarding the
    tick's other work — the same reason `vendor_rescreen` and
    `recurring_invoices` moved off a single per-tenant transaction. The
    **per-row `try`** is the other half of that claim, and without it the claim
    was false: ids are read `ORDER BY id ASC`, and a raise propagated straight
    out of this function, so a single row whose reap kept failing (a malformed
    workflow snapshot, an audit write that will not land) aborted the loop at
    the same place on every tick and **no invoice with a higher id was ever
    reaped again**. Nothing about that row changes between ticks, so it is a
    permanent block — the tail starvation `../docs/background-sweeps.md`
    § Locking warns about, arriving through error handling rather than through
    a cap.
