"""Resolve the effective PO-match rule for an invoice.

PO matching has two tunable knobs: ``require_inspection`` (does a matched PO
need a quality-inspection record before the invoice clears the 4-way leg) and
``tolerance_pct`` (the allowed amount variance vs. the PO). Historically both
came from a single per-org setting. This module lets an org configure either
knob *per vendor* or *per commodity type*, falling back to the org default.

"Commodity type" is the invoice's header GL account (``invoice.gl_account``, a
``String(100)`` column that already exists) — no new DB columns.

The settings shape (all keys optional, backward-compatible) lives under
``Organization.settings.matching``::

    {
      "matching": {
        "require_inspection": false,
        "tolerance_pct": 5.0,
        "vendor_rules":    { "<vendor_id_uuid_str>": { "require_inspection": true,
                                                       "tolerance_pct": 2.0 } },
        "commodity_rules": { "<gl_account_code>":     { "require_inspection": true,
                                                       "tolerance_pct": 1.0 } }
      }
    }

Precedence is **per-field** (not whole-rule): for each of ``require_inspection``
and ``tolerance_pct`` independently, take the first present value walking

    vendor_rules[str(vendor_id)]  →  commodity_rules[gl_account]  →
    matching.<field>  →  hardcoded default (require_inspection=False, tolerance_pct=5.0)

So a vendor rule that only sets ``require_inspection`` still lets
``tolerance_pct`` fall through to the commodity / org / default layers.

The resolver is pure (no DB, no I/O) and never raises: malformed config —
non-dict rules, missing keys, ``vendor_id``/``gl_account`` ``None``, non-numeric
tolerance — is silently ignored in favour of the next layer down.

``tolerance_pct`` accepts a number **or its exact decimal string** ("1.0"), the
representation this project already uses for money in JSONB and the one
``po_matching.match_invoice_to_po`` already declares in its signature. That
matters because falling through here does not fail closed: the walk ends at
``DEFAULT_TOLERANCE_PCT`` (5.0), which is looser than any tolerance an org
would configure, so an unparsed value silently WIDENS the gate it was meant to
tighten.

    **A numeric STRING is accepted**, and that matters more here than anywhere
    else in this module. These rules live in a hand-edited JSONB blob, where an
    exact decimal string is the project's own preferred representation for a
    money-ish number (`auto_approve_below` is stored that way in
    `steps_config`), and `po_matching.match_invoice_to_po` already types its
    `tolerance_pct` parameter `Decimal | float | int | str`. Rejecting `"1.0"`
    made the resolver disagree with its only consumer — and, because `None`
    means "fall through", the walk terminated at `DEFAULT_TOLERANCE_PCT` (5.0),
    which is LOOSER than any tolerance an org would bother configuring. A
    high-risk supplier tightened to 1% silently got 5%, so an invoice 4.5% over
    its PO read `within_tolerance: True` → `matched` → no `po_mismatch`
    exception → straight into the approval queue as clean. The resolver never
    raises and never logs, so nothing surfaced it.

    Bools are still rejected (a bool is an int subclass, and `true` would
    resolve to a 1% tolerance nobody asked for), as are non-finite values —
    both fall through to the next layer rather than becoming a rule.
