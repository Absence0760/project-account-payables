    **No config → `mock`** (unchanged): that is the local-first default, and
    an org that has never configured a processor is a normal state.

    **A configured provider we have no adapter for → `UnknownPaymentProviderError`.**
    This used to fall back to `mock` too, on the reasoning that a
    misconfigured org shouldn't 500 the payments domain. That trade was
    wrong in this family, because `mock` is not an inert stub: its
    `create_payment` returns `success=True, status=completed` immediately,
    so a single typo in an admin-supplied settings value (`modern-treasury`
    for `modern_treasury`) made every payment in every run report as settled
    while no money moved, and flipped the invoices to `paid`. Its
    `parse_webhook` also performs NO signature verification, so the same
    typo routed the public webhook route — whose `provider == "mock"`
    early-return exists precisely to prevent that — to an unverified parser
    under a different name.

    Failing closed is the same call `decisions.md` §26 made for extraction,
    where an unrecognised provider name reached a *fixture* adapter. There
    the fix was a boot-time allowlist, because the name came from an env
    var; here it comes from per-org DB settings, so the refusal has to live
    at the dispatcher and each caller decides what to do with it.
