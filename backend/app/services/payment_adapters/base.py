"""Base payment adapter interface.

Adapters are responsible for the *external* leg of paying a vendor: handing
the payment off to a bank or processor and returning a tracking ID. The
internal Payment row is owned by `app.api.payments` — adapters don't touch
the DB.

Status lifecycle:

    pending → submitted → completed
                       ↘ failed
                       ↘ cancelled

`pending` means we've created the row locally but haven't called the
processor yet (a transient state during execute_payment_run). `submitted`
means the processor accepted the request — money is in flight but not yet
settled. `completed` is the terminal success state. `failed` and
`cancelled` are terminal too. Webhooks drive the submitted → completed
transition; we don't poll.
