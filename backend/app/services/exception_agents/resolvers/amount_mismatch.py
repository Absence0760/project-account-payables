"""Amount-mismatch resolver — auto-fix a small PO-vs-invoice amount variance.

Handles ``exception_type == "po_mismatch"`` where the ONLY issue is an amount
variance within a configurable tolerance: adjust the invoice amount to the PO
total and approve. Anything else (missing PO, partial 3-way, variance over the
band, CFO-gated amount) escalates to a human.

The PO total and match status are read by re-running ``match_invoice_to_po``
against the LIVE ``PurchaseOrder`` row — both in ``evaluate`` and again under
the invoice row lock in ``apply`` — rather than trusting the (possibly stale)
``invoice.po_match`` JSONB snapshot. Only a live ``status == "matched"`` is
auto-fixable; a ``partial`` 3-way receipt (goods not fully received) escalates.

Currency note: the schema gives a ``PurchaseOrder`` no currency of its own —
its ``total`` is denominated in the invoice's currency — so there is no
cross-currency comparison to make here. If per-PO currency is ever added, this
resolver must gate on ``invoice.currency == po.currency`` before adjusting.
