"""Missing-PO resolver — auto-link an invoice whose referenced PO doesn't exist
to the right PurchaseOrder by vendor + amount + date, then resolve.

Handles ``exception_type == "po_mismatch"`` where the live match status is
``no_po`` — the invoice references a ``po_number`` that doesn't resolve to any
PurchaseOrder (a typo'd / mis-extracted number, or a number whose PO sits under
a different vendor). The right PO usually *does* exist; the agent searches the
tenant's open POs for a single confident candidate by

  * **vendor** — the invoice's ``vendor_id`` (exact), or a fuzzy match of its
    ``vendor_name`` against the PO's vendor when no ``vendor_id`` is linked;
  * **amount** — the PO ``total`` within the org's PO-match tolerance band of the
    invoice amount (reusing ``matching_rules.resolve_match_rule``);
  * **date** — the PO created on/around the invoice date (POs precede invoices),
    within a configurable window. Skipped when the invoice has no ``invoice_date``.

Exactly **one** candidate clearing all three legs → high confidence: re-point the
invoice's ``po_number`` to that PO (the link is by ``po_number`` + ``vendor_id``;
there is no ``Invoice.po_id`` FK), refresh the PO-match snapshot, and — only when
the now-live match is a clean ``matched`` and the invoice is review-ready and
under the CFO/maximum gate — approve through the SAME audited path a human uses
(``review.approve_invoice``). Zero or multiple ambiguous candidates → escalate.

No new column / migration: linking is ``invoice.po_number`` (and aligning
``invoice.vendor_id`` to the PO's), mirroring how ``po_matching`` already resolves
a PO. Currency note matches ``amount_mismatch``: a PurchaseOrder carries no
currency of its own — its ``total`` is denominated in the invoice's currency.
