"""GL-coding resolver — correct an invoice's GL account (and cost center) from
the vendor's dominant historical coding, then approve through the audited path.

Handles ``exception_type == "missing_data"`` where the actionable gap is a
**missing or inconsistent GL account**: the invoice has no ``gl_account`` (or one
that disagrees with how this vendor has been coded every other time), and the
vendor's approved history shows a single dominant GL the reviewer would almost
certainly pick. The agent fills / corrects that one field and approves.

The dominant-value statistics are NOT reimplemented here — they reuse the pure
``vendor_enrichment.suggest_fields`` primitive (the same dominance-ratio math the
``/api/enrichment/.../suggestions`` surface uses). This resolver only adds the
exception-agent wiring: pull the vendor's approved-history rows, ask
``suggest_fields`` for the dominant ``gl_account`` (and ``cost_center``), map the
dominance ratio to a confidence, and — when a single dominant value clears the
bar — apply it through ``review.approve_invoice(corrections=…)``, the SAME audited
correction path a human approver uses.

Disjoint, idempotent, money-safe:

  * **Disjoint** from the (future) other ``missing_data`` strategies behind the
    ``missing_data`` dispatcher: this resolver only recommends a fix when it has a
    confident GL suggestion AND the *only* remaining missing-field gap is the GL
    coding. A genuinely missing vendor / amount / invoice-number escalates (a GL
    fix wouldn't make the invoice payable).
  * **Idempotent** — ``apply`` re-locks the invoice, re-asserts review-readiness,
    and re-derives the suggestion under the lock; a concurrent run that already
    coded + approved leaves the invoice out of ``ready_for_review`` and this run
    escalates rather than double-acting.
  * **Money-safe** — it recodes the GL only; it never touches ``amount`` and never
    self-approves past the CFO / maximum gate (escalates instead, exactly like the
    PO resolvers).

No new column / migration: ``gl_account`` / ``cost_center`` already live on
``Invoice``; the correction is written through ``approve_invoice`` so the
``invoice.approved`` audit row carries the field diff (string-typed, PII-free).
