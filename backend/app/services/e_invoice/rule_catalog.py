"""Enumerate every ``FieldError.code`` the e-invoice validators can emit.

`decisions.md` §95 moved the 422 body to FastAPI's ``[{loc, type, msg}]`` shape
and, with it, deleted the client's hand-written code→prose table — a table that
covered 4 codes and 12 field paths out of dozens, so most rows already rendered
a bare rule id. It named the durable replacement: a code→message-key map
**generated from the backend's own rule set**, so the catalogue cannot drift
from the validator. This module is the enumeration half of that.

**Why a source scan rather than a registry.** The rule ids are literal strings
in the 2nd positional argument of ``_err`` / ``FieldError`` — 18 of them across
``en16931_rules`` plus the generic kinds in ``validate`` / ``bis3`` /
``tax_rules`` / ``country_formats``. Turning them into a constant table the
validators index would be a wide refactor of code that reads well as it stands,
and would not actually close the drift: an author can add a table entry and
forget to use it, or use a literal and forget the table. Scanning the source is
derived by construction — the same reasoning, and the same mechanism, as
``tests/test_exception_type_labels.py``, which AST-scans ``app/`` for the
``exception_type`` values raised.

**The per-category families.** ``codelists.vat_category_rule(category, suffix)``
computes ``BR-<infix>-<suffix>`` at runtime, so those ids appear in no source
literal. Each such call site is expanded over every infix in
``VAT_CATEGORY_RULE_INFIX``. That deliberately OVER-generates: the ``-05``
family is only reached for ``ZERO_RATE_VAT_CATEGORIES``, a runtime guard a scan
cannot see. An unreachable extra entry costs one row in the generated map and
covers a future widening of that subset for free, whereas under-generating
would leave a real refusal unlocalized.

**Literals win over the family expansion.** ``BR-S-05`` is emitted as a literal
with its own wording ("a standard-rated line requires a rate ABOVE zero"), the
mirror image of the family's "this category requires a ZERO rate"; and
``BR-CL-18`` is both a literal and ``vat_category_rule``'s own fallback for an
unrecognised category. In both cases the literal is the specific statement, so
it takes precedence.
