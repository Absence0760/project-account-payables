"""WebAuthn / passkey MFA — registration + authentication ceremonies.

A passkey is an ADDITIONAL second factor alongside the TOTP/email-OTP flow in
``services/mfa.py`` (which keeps working unchanged). This module owns the
separate WebAuthn code path: it wraps the maintained ``py_webauthn`` library to

  * mint **registration** options (``begin_registration``) and verify the
    browser's ``navigator.credentials.create()`` response
    (``finish_registration``) — persisting a ``WebAuthnCredential`` row;
  * mint **authentication** options (``begin_authentication``) and verify the
    browser's ``navigator.credentials.get()`` response
    (``finish_authentication``) — bumping the credential's signature counter
    (clone-detection) on success.

The per-ceremony random challenge is server-minted and stashed in Redis under a
short TTL keyed to the user, so the verify call can't be fed an attacker-chosen
challenge. Nothing here logs credential material; the WebAuthn public key is not
a secret in the password sense (the private key never leaves the authenticator),
so there is no bcrypt/sops concern — but we still keep it out of logs.

The RP ID / allowed origins are NOT read from config here. They are resolved
per request by ``services/webauthn_rp`` (from the host the ceremony is actually
running on, validated against the tenant's registered custom domains) and passed
in as a ``RelyingParty`` — a required argument on every ceremony function, with
no default, so a call site cannot silently fall back to a different RP than the
one its counterpart used. The RP ID the ``begin`` step minted under is also
stored alongside the challenge and re-checked on ``finish``, so a ceremony
started on one host can never be completed against another. Local-first: the
defaults still work on ``*.localhost:7777`` with no cloud account.
