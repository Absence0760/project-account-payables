"""Inter-company invoice routing (multi-entity).

An inter-company charge is an invoice owed between two legal entities /
subsidiaries of the SAME tenant: entity A bills entity B. When such an invoice
names a counterparty entity (``invoice.counterparty_entity_id``), this service
generates the mirror **payable** under the counterparty entity, links the two
invoices bidirectionally, and audits both — so each subsidiary's books reflect
the transaction.

Design notes:
- **Idempotent.** ``intercompany_mirror_id`` on the origin is the dedupe guard:
  if it's already set, the mirror exists and the existing one is returned — a
  second call never creates a duplicate payable. No money moves here (the mirror
  enters the normal approval queue at ``new``), but a duplicate payable is a real
  accounting problem, so the guard is mandatory.
- **Money is exact.** The mirror copies the origin ``amount`` (``Decimal``)
  verbatim — never a float round-trip.
- The mirror enters via the normal workflow entry point
  (``workflow_engine.create_workflow_instance``) at status ``new``, exactly like
  any other freshly-created invoice — it is NOT slipped past the state machine.

See backend/docs/inter-company.md.
