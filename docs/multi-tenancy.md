# Multi-Tenancy

The application uses **subdomain-based routing** with **database-per-tenant isolation**. Each tenant gets a unique subdomain and their own PostgreSQL database.

## Architecture

```
acme.localhost:7777 ──┐                        ┌── feoh_acme DB (invoices, vendors, ...)
                      ├── Backend API :8000 ────┼── feoh_techflow DB
techflow.localhost:7777┘   (shared)             └── feohledger DB (control plane)
```

- **Control-plane DB** (`feohledger`): organizations, users, roles
- **Tenant DBs** (`feoh_<slug>`): invoices, vendors, payments, workflows, exceptions

## How It Works

### 1. Frontend extracts subdomain

`src/lib/tenant.ts` reads the subdomain from the browser URL:
- `acme.localhost:7777` → slug `acme`
- `techflow.app.com` → slug `techflow`
- `localhost:7777` (no subdomain) → shows "no tenant" page

### 2. Frontend sends tenant header

Every API request includes an `X-Tenant-Slug` header (added automatically by `src/lib/api.ts`).

### 3. Backend resolves tenant

The dependency chain in `app/tenant.py`:
```
X-Tenant-Slug header + Authorization Bearer <JWT>
  → get_tenant_slug()        # extract slug from header
  → get_tenant()             # look up org in control-plane DB by slug
                             # CROSS-CHECK: payload["org"] must equal org.id
                             #              for employee tokens (typ != "vendor")
                             #              → 403 on mismatch
  → get_tenant_db()          # yield a session on the tenant's DB
```

The cross-check in `get_tenant` is the load-bearing security control. Without it, an authenticated user from tenant A could read or mutate tenant B's data by sending `X-Tenant-Slug: <other-tenant>`. Vendor-portal tokens (`typ="vendor"`) are exempt — they're scoped naturally because `VendorUser` rows live in the per-tenant DB. See `docs/authentication.md § Cross-tenant guard`.

### Engine construction is the other half of the guard

`get_tenant` being *correct* is only useful if it is *used*. A tenant session is
never more isolated than the URL its engine was built from, and a URL is a
string — a module that writes

```python
create_async_engine(f"{base}/feoh_{slug}")     # slug straight off the request
```

reaches a tenant database with no `Organization` row behind it, so every check
in `get_tenant` sits upstream of a call that never happens. `tests/test_tenant_isolation.py`
would still be green.

So the construction discipline is asserted too, by
**`backend/tests/test_tenant_engine_construction.py`** — a pure-AST scan over
`backend/app/`, no database, sub-second. It enforces five things:

1. **One builder.** `app/database.py` owns engine construction; `_make_tenant_url(db_name)`
   is the single place a tenant DB name becomes a URL. Every engine built elsewhere
   must be handed `_make_tenant_url(...)` (tenant) or `settings.database_url`
   (control plane) — directly, or via a local assigned from one of them. The scan
   follows renamed imports (`create_async_engine as make_engine`), covers the
   synchronous `create_engine` twin, and treats a `**kwargs`-hidden or
   later-mutated URL as unresolved, so the easy ways around it fail closed.
2. **The constructor is never renamed.** A constructor bound to another name
   (`engine_factory = create_async_engine`) or passed as a value takes every call
   through it *out of the enumeration* rather than into the offender list, so a
   non-call reference is refused outright.
3. **No interpolated URLs.** No f-string, `%`, or `.format()` anywhere in an
   engine's URL expression — the exempt modules included.
4. **Narrow exemptions.** The three AWS Lambda handlers (`extraction_lambda`,
   `erp_lambda`, `audit_lambda`) cannot import `app.database` (it reaches
   `app.config`; see backend/CLAUDE.md on dotenv-free Lambda paths), so they read
   the control URL from the environment and inline `_make_tenant_url`'s body.
   They are exempt from the *helper*, not from the rule: the guard asserts each
   still mirrors that body structurally, and a stale exemption on a module that
   no longer builds an engine fails too.
5. **No hardcoded tenant DB names.** A `feoh_`-prefixed database-name literal
   appears nowhere outside `app/config.py`, which owns `tenant_db_prefix`.

The `tenant-url-interpolation` and `hardcoded-tenant-db-name` rules in
`.claude/hooks/security-patterns.sh` catch the same two shapes earlier, at edit
time. They are line-based greps, so they see a URL interpolated *at* the call —
positionally or as `url=` — but not one assembled on an earlier line and passed
by name, and not a renamed constructor. The pytest guard resolves both; the hook
is the fast first pass, never the backstop.

What no static rule can prove is that a given `db_name` came from a *resolved
row* rather than from the request. What the guard does prove is that every call
site goes through the one helper whose only caller-visible input is a `db_name`,
which turns reviewing a new engine site into a one-line question instead of an
audit.

### Custom-domain fallback (white-label vanity hostnames)

When the `X-Tenant-Slug` header is **absent**, `get_tenant_slug` falls back to matching the request `Host` against the per-org `settings.brand.custom_domains` JSON array, so a tenant served on its own vanity hostname (`ap.acmecorp.com`) resolves to its slug without the SPA supplying the header. An unknown / unmatched host (or a malformed settings blob) falls back to the original `400` — never a wrong tenant. **The fallback only picks a *candidate* slug; the `get_tenant` JWT `org`-claim cross-check above still gates it**, so a forged `Host` header can no more widen access than a forged `X-Tenant-Slug` header can. The list is managed by tenant admins via `GET/PUT /api/organization/branding/custom-domains` (admin-only mutate; each host normalized through the same `normalize_custom_domain` the resolver uses, **cross-org-unique** — a host registered to another tenant is `409` — and audited count-only) + the Organization → Custom Domains panel. See `docs/white-label.md § Custom domains` for the full trust model.

### 4. Routes use the correct database

- **Auth routes** (`/api/auth/*`) use the control-plane DB — users and orgs live there
- **Business routes** (`/api/invoices`, `/api/vendors`, `/api/dashboard`) use the tenant DB — data is fully isolated per tenant. Every route flows through `get_tenant` so the cross-check fires uniformly.

## Database Layout

### Control-plane DB (`feohledger`)

| Table                  | Purpose                                                          |

| `email_verifications`  | Pending self-service signups (token, slug, expires_at)           |
| `extraction_usage`     | Per-invoice billing rows for platform extraction                 |
| `card_rebates`         | Per-virtual-card rebate billing rows                             |

### Tenant DB (`feoh_<slug>`)

Tenant tables still have an `organization_id` column (as a plain UUID, not a foreign key) for backward compatibility.

## Provisioning a New Tenant

```bash
cd backend
source .venv/bin/activate
python scripts/create_tenant.py \
  --name "New Corp" \
  --slug newcorp \
  --admin-email admin@newcorp.com \
  --admin-password changeme
```

This:
1. Creates `feoh_newcorp` database on the Postgres server
2. Inserts the org row into the control-plane DB
3. Creates the admin user in the control-plane DB
4. Creates all tenant tables in `feoh_newcorp`

The new tenant is immediately accessible at `newcorp.localhost:7777`.

## Migrations

### Control-plane DB

```bash
cd backend
alembic upgrade head
```

### Single tenant DB

```bash
FEOH_MIGRATE_TENANT=feoh_acme alembic upgrade head
```

### All tenant DBs

```bash
python scripts/migrate_all_tenants.py
```

## CORS

The backend uses a regex-based CORS policy to allow any subdomain:

```python
allow_origin_regex=r"https?://([\w-]+\.)?(localhost(:\d+)?|app\.com)"
```

This accepts `acme.localhost:7777`, `techflow.localhost:7777`, `acme.app.com`, etc.

## Local Development

### DNS

`*.localhost` resolves to `127.0.0.1` natively in Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. No `/etc/hosts` changes needed.

For Safari, add entries manually:

```
# /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1 acme.localhost techflow.localhost
```

### Dev URLs

| Tenant    | URL                           | Login                          |
|-----------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Acme      | http://acme.localhost:7777    | `demo@acme.com` / `demo`      |
| TechFlow  | http://techflow.localhost:7777| `admin@techflow.com` / `demo`  |

### Docker

The `docker-compose.yml` mounts `init-tenants.sql` which auto-creates `feoh_acme` and `feoh_techflow` databases on first run. For a fresh start:

```bash
docker compose down -v
docker compose up -d
python scripts/seed.py
```

## Engine Pool Management

Each tenant gets a lazily-created `AsyncEngine` with `pool_size=5, max_overflow=10`. Engines are cached in `app/database._tenant_engines` and disposed on shutdown. For production with many tenants, consider adding a connection pooler like PgBouncer.
