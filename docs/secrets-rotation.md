# Secrets rotation

What we rotate, how often, and the procedure for each. The auditor expects every secret with material blast radius to have a documented owner, cadence, and rotation playbook.

This is a SOC 2 prerequisite (`docs/soc2-readiness.md` § Secrets management).

---

## Inventory + cadence

| Secret | Where it lives | Cadence | Blast radius if leaked |
|---|---|---|---|
| `FEOH_SECRET_KEY` (JWT signing) | `backend/.env.sops` | **90 days** | Forge any user's JWT; full impersonation |
| AWS KMS key for SOPS | AWS KMS | **365 days (auto)** | Decrypt every encrypted secret in the repo |
| RDS master password | AWS Secrets Manager | **90 days** | Full DB read/write |
| `FEOH_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (platform Claude Vision) | `backend/.env.sops` | **180 days** | Anthropic billing fraud, prompt extraction abuse |
| `FEOH_LITHIC_API_KEY` (virtual cards — platform) | `backend/.env.sops` | **180 days** | Issue cards on our account |
| `FEOH_NIUM_CLIENT_*` (virtual cards — platform) | `backend/.env.sops` | **180 days** | Issue cards on our account |
| `FEOH_HCAPTCHA_SECRET` (signup) | `backend/.env.sops` | **365 days** (or on suspected leak) | Bypass signup captcha |
| AWS SES credentials (transactional email) | IAM role (preferred) or `backend/.env.sops` | **365 days** if static | Send email from our domain |
| GitHub Actions OIDC role | AWS IAM role (no static keys) | n/a — short-lived | n/a |
| Per-tenant SCIM bearer tokens | `Organization.settings.sso.scim_bearer_hash` (sha256) | **On request** by tenant admin via `POST /api/organization/sso/scim-token` | Read/write users on that one tenant |
| Per-tenant OIDC client secret | `Organization.settings.sso.client_secret` (encrypted at row) | **On request** by tenant admin | Mint OIDC tokens for that one tenant |
| Per-tenant chat webhook URL (Slack / Teams) | `Organization.settings.chat_notifications.webhook_url` | **On request** by tenant admin via `PUT /api/organization/chat-notifications/webhook` | Post arbitrary content into that tenant's approval channel — a phishing surface aimed at the people who approve payments |

**Triggers for an out-of-band rotation** — do these even if the cadence hasn't fired:
- Suspected leak (commit, log, screenshot, employee departure)
- Vendor breach affecting the third party that holds the secret
- Engineer who handled the secret leaves the team

## Procedures

### `FEOH_SECRET_KEY` (JWT signing key)

The riskiest secret in the system — leaks let an attacker forge any user's session.

1. Generate a new key:
   ```bash
   openssl rand -hex 32
   ```
2. Edit the SOPS file:
   ```bash
   sops backend/.env.sops
   ```
   Update `FEOH_SECRET_KEY` to the new value.
3. Deploy. **Every existing JWT becomes invalid immediately** — all users are forced to re-login. This is the intended behaviour.
4. Record the rotation in the compliance vendor's evidence locker (date, who rotated, ticket if any).

If you need a graceful rollover, support two keys (current + previous) for one rotation cycle. Not implemented today — accepted because forced re-login is acceptable for the user count.

### AWS KMS key (SOPS encryption)

The KMS key encrypts every secret in `backend/.env.sops` and `infra/terraform.tfvars.sops`.

**Auto-rotation** — preferred. AWS KMS rotates the key material annually with no operator action when the `EnableKeyRotation` flag is set:
```bash
aws kms enable-key-rotation --key-id alias/feohledger-sops
aws kms get-key-rotation-status --key-id alias/feohledger-sops
```

**Manual rotation to a brand-new key** — if the key needs to be replaced (compromised IAM principal, audit finding):
1. Create a new key + alias:
   ```bash
   aws kms create-key --description 'AP SOPS rotation' --key-usage ENCRYPT_DECRYPT
   aws kms create-alias --alias-name alias/feohledger-sops-new --target-key-id <new-key-id>
   ```
2. Update `.sops.yaml` to point at the new alias.
3. Re-encrypt every SOPS file under the new key:
   ```bash
   sops updatekeys backend/.env.sops
   sops updatekeys infra/terraform.tfvars.sops
   ```
4. Commit + push.
5. After 30 days with no incidents, schedule deletion of the old key:
   ```bash
   aws kms schedule-key-deletion --key-id <old-key-id> --pending-window-in-days 30
   ```

### RDS master password

1. Pick a new password (≥ 32 chars, generated):
   ```bash
   openssl rand -base64 32 | tr -d '/+=' | head -c 40
   ```
2. Update via the AWS Console or CLI:
   ```bash
   aws rds modify-db-instance --db-instance-identifier feoh-prod \
     --master-user-password '<new>' --apply-immediately
   ```
3. Update `FEOH_DATABASE_URL` in `backend/.env.sops`.
4. Deploy. Application reconnects with the new password.
5. Rotate any other consumers (read replicas, BI tools).

### Third-party API keys (Anthropic, Lithic, Nium, hCaptcha, SES)

Same pattern for each:
1. Mint a new key in the provider's dashboard.
2. Update the corresponding env var in `backend/.env.sops`.
3. Deploy.
4. Verify a request succeeds against the new key (e.g. trigger an extraction → log shows new key, billing dashboard logs a request).
5. Revoke the old key in the provider's dashboard.

For Anthropic + OpenAI specifically, **never reuse a key across environments** (dev/staging/prod each have their own). If a key is leaked from a single env, the blast radius is contained.

### Per-tenant SCIM bearer

Tenant admin self-serves rotation by re-calling `POST /api/organization/sso/scim-token`. The new token is shown once in the response; the old hash is overwritten in `org.settings.sso.scim_bearer_hash`. Any IdP still using the old token starts getting 401s — this is the desired behaviour because it forces the IdP to be reconfigured with the fresh token.

### Per-tenant OIDC client secret

Tenant admin updates the secret in their Okta/Entra app, then PATCHes `org.settings.sso.client_secret` via `PATCH /api/organization`. SSO handshakes after the change use the new secret. **No grace period** — coordinate with the IdP cutover.

### Per-subscription outbound-webhook signing secret

Tenant admin self-serves via `POST /api/webhooks/{id}/rotate-secret`. The new secret is shown once; the subscription keeps its id and its **entire delivery history** (unlike delete-and-recreate, which CASCADE-deletes the delivery log — recovering from a leak used to mean destroying the record of what had been delivered).

**Unlike the two above, this one has a grace period.** By default the retiring secret keeps signing a second `X-Webhook-Signature-Previous` header for 60 minutes (max 1440), so a receiver that accepts either header rotates with zero dropped deliveries. Pass `overlap_minutes: 0` for a hard cutover when the secret is known-compromised and must stop verifying immediately.

The receiver-side procedure — and the reason step 1 has to happen *before* you need it — is in [public-api.md](../backend/docs/public-api.md) § Rotating a signing secret. Audited as `webhook_subscription.secret_rotated`, recording the prefix and window, never either secret.

### Per-tenant chat-notification webhook URL (Slack / Teams)

A Slack or Teams **incoming-webhook URL is a credential, not an address**: the token lives in the path, and anyone holding the string can post arbitrary content into the tenant's approval channel forever, unauthenticated. That is a phishing surface pointed directly at the people who approve payments, so it belongs in this inventory even though it never enters a SOPS file (it's per-tenant config, like the SCIM bearer above).

Tenant admin self-serves, admin-only, on `/organization` → **Chat Notifications**:

1. **Delete the compromised webhook at the provider first** (Slack: the app's *Incoming Webhooks* page; Teams: the channel connector). *We cannot do this step* — the URL is issued by them and revoked by them. Until it's revoked there, the old URL still works no matter what we store.
2. Create a replacement webhook at the provider and copy the new URL.
3. `PUT /api/organization/chat-notifications/webhook` with the new URL. The replacement is **atomic**.
4. If you need containment *before* you have a replacement, `DELETE /api/organization/chat-notifications/webhook` instead. The adapters already fail closed with no URL (a no-op plus a PII-free warning), so the fan-out stops immediately and the rest of the org's chat config is left alone. Idempotent.

**Unlike the outbound-webhook signing secret above, there is deliberately no grace period.** That one rotates an HMAC *verifier* held by a counterparty, so an overlap window lets the receiver switch keys without dropping deliveries. This is a *destination*: we POST to exactly one URL, nobody else holds the old value, and keeping it live would mean posting every approval event into the compromised channel as well. An overlap here would extend the leak, not smooth a cutover.

Nothing is "shown once" either — we don't mint this value, the provider does, so the admin already has it. **No endpoint ever returns the stored URL**; reads report only whether one is configured plus its bare hostname (`hooks.slack.com`), which is enough to answer "where does our approval channel post?" during an incident without handing back the token. That holds for the generic `GET /api/organization` too — it serves the settings JSONB and used to return the credential in full to *any* authenticated role, so its response is now projected (`services/org_settings_view`), dropping this key for every role and stripping the other settings-JSON credentials for non-admins. `PATCH /api/organization` refuses a `chat_notifications` key, so the audited endpoint is the only writer.

Audited as `organization.chat_webhook_rotated` on both set/replace and removal (flagged `removed`), recording the previous and new **hostnames** only — never the URL. One action name covers the credential's whole lifecycle so an incident can be reconstructed with a single grep. Mechanics: [notifications.md](../backend/docs/notifications.md) § Rotating the webhook URL.

## Logging + audit

Every rotation must leave a paper trail:

- **Code rotations** (`FEOH_SECRET_KEY`, third-party keys) — visible in git history because they touch `backend/.env.sops`. The rotator notes the secret name + date in the commit message (don't mention values).
- **AWS rotations** (KMS, RDS) — CloudTrail captures the API call. Compliance vendor pulls it as evidence.
- **Tenant rotations** (SCIM, OIDC) — application audit log writes a `tenant.scim_token_rotated` / `tenant.sso_secret_rotated` row (auth audit logging is on the SOC 2 prereq list — see `docs/soc2-readiness.md` § Logging).
- **Tenant chat-webhook rotations** — `organization.chat_webhook_rotated` into the tenant trail, hostnames only. This one is worth pulling as evidence in its own right: it is the only record that a leaked approval-channel credential was replaced, and before the endpoint existed the change was an untracked hand-edit of the settings JSON.

## Things that should never be secrets

If any of these end up in a SOPS file, they're misclassified — move them out:

- Non-sensitive endpoint URLs (already in plain `backend/.env.development`)
- Feature flags (use config, not secrets)
- Tenant slugs, plan names, feature toggles
- AWS region, account ID (treated as low-sensitivity by AWS itself)

---

## What we don't have yet

- **HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager dynamic credentials** — DB credentials are still long-lived. Once volume warrants it, switch RDS auth to IAM tokens (15-minute lifetime, no static password to rotate).
- **Automated rotation runners** — Vanta/Drata can ping us to rotate; AWS Secrets Manager can do it for RDS automatically. Pending until SOC 2 is live.
- **SBOM + signed images** — supply-chain hardening is on the roadmap, separate from secrets.
