# White-Label / Partner Branding

Per-tenant white-labeling so an organization can present the app under its own
product name, logo, and accent colors. Shipped so far:

1. **Brand config + frontend theming** (first slice) — `settings.brand`,
   `GET/PUT /api/organization/branding`, CSS custom-property theming.
2. **Branded outbound surfaces** — the generated PDFs (remittance,
   1099 working copy, SOX audit report) and outbound transactional emails carry
   the tenant's product name + logo + accent, not the platform's.
3. **Custom domains** — a tenant can be served on its own vanity
   hostname (`ap.acmecorp.com`) and have the backend resolve it to the right
   tenant, in addition to the `*.localhost` subdomain / `X-Tenant-Slug`
   mechanism. The SPA half is `PUBLIC_PLATFORM_DOMAINS` (which hosts are the
   platform's) plus a runtime-resolved API origin. See
   [Custom domains](#custom-domains-vanity-hostnames) below.
4. **Partner / reseller admin** (this slice) — a partner (reseller) org can
   administer a set of branded **child** tenants: list them, read each child's
   branding, and push branding to a child. See
   [Partner / reseller admin](#partner--reseller-admin) below.

## What it covers

| Field | Stored as | Effect |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| `product_name` | `settings.brand.product_name` | Sidebar product name + document `<title>`. Fallback: **"FeohLedger"**. |
| `logo_url` | `settings.brand.logo_url` | Sidebar logo `<img>`. Fallback: the bundled "AP" mark. |
| `accent_color` | `settings.brand.accent_color` | Overrides the `--accent` CSS token (borders, focus rings, accent text). |
| `accent_strong_color` | `settings.brand.accent_strong_color` | Overrides the `--accent-strong` token (text-bearing accent backgrounds — buttons, active chips). |
| `support_url` | `settings.brand.support_url` | Reserved for support links (exposed via the brand store). |
| `legal_url` | `settings.brand.legal_url` | Reserved for legal/terms links (exposed via the brand store). |

No migration — the brand block lives in `Organization.settings` JSONB, exactly
like `residency` and `chat_notifications`.

## Backend

`GET /api/organization/branding` — returns the tenant's `BrandConfig`. **Read
gated to any authenticated org user** (the whole app themes itself, not just
admins), mirroring `GET /api/organization` / data-residency. An empty field
means "use the platform default".

`PUT /api/organization/branding` — **admin-only** (`require_roles(ROLE_ADMIN)`).
Validated by the Pydantic `BrandConfig` schema (`app/schemas/organization.py`):

- `accent_color` / `accent_strong_color` must be a 3- or 6-digit **hex literal**
  (`#638cff` / `#abc`) — the value is injected verbatim into a CSS custom
  property, so nothing else (no `url(...)`, `expression()`, etc.) is permitted.
- `logo_url` / `support_url` / `legal_url` must be **http(s) URLs** — the logo
  renders as `<img src>` and the links as `<a href>`, so `javascript:`,
  `data:`, and other schemes are rejected.

**A legal hex can still be an illegible one, and the UI says so.**
`accent_strong_color` overrides `--accent-strong`, whose single contract is
that white text sits on it — every primary button, active filter chip and the
skip link read off it. So a tenant picking the yellow from their logo makes
those unreadable across the whole app, and the stylesheet contrast guard
(`frontend/src/lib/a11y/tokenPairing.test.ts`) structurally cannot see it: that
scan runs over the sources, this override happens at runtime. Both surfaces
that edit the colour — the `/organization` Branding panel and the
`/admin/partner` child-branding modal, where the consequence lands on somebody
else's users — show the real white-on-colour ratio inline as the field is
typed (`stores/brandTheme.ts` `accentStrongContrast`, `ui/FieldWarning`).

It is **advisory, not a block.** The backend accepts any valid hex on purpose:
the brand is the tenant's call, and a hard refusal would make the API the
arbiter of a design decision. What was missing was anyone stating the cost
before it is saved. See [accessibility.md](accessibility.md) and
[decisions.md](decisions.md) §28.

The mutate path writes `org.settings["brand"]` via `flag_modified` (nested JSONB
in-place mutation isn't auto-marked dirty) and audits
`organization.branding_updated` into the tenant trail. The audit detail is
**PII-free and value-free** — it records only *which* fields are now set
(booleans), never the configured values.

A persisted-but-now-invalid brand block never breaks the read: `_resolve_brand`
falls back to all-empty (= platform defaults).

## Frontend

**Brand store** — `frontend/src/lib/stores/brand.svelte.ts` (a Svelte 5 rune
store). Lazy-loads the branding once per session (`ensureLoaded()`), exactly
like `orgCurrency`: cache + single in-flight request + resilient fallback to
defaults on any failure. Exposes `productName`, `logoUrl`, `supportUrl`,
`legalUrl`, plus `applyTheme()` / `ensureLoadedAndApply()` / `reset()`.

**Pure theming helpers** — `frontend/src/lib/stores/brandTheme.ts` (runtime-free,
unit-tested under vitest): `isValidHexColor()` and `brandThemeVars(brand)`. The
latter returns only the CSS custom-property overrides for colors the org
configured **with a valid hex** — an unset or malformed color is omitted so the
AA-passing `src/app.css` default token stands. The theme is **never duplicated**;
only `--accent` / `--accent-strong` are overridden.

**Application** — `frontend/src/routes/+layout.svelte` runs an `$effect` (gated
on the user being fully signed into a tenant, since the read needs auth) that
calls `brand.ensureLoadedAndApply()`. `applyTheme()` writes the configured
accent tokens onto `document.documentElement.style` (or removes them when
unset). The document `<title>` and the sidebar logo + product name read the
store reactively. `reset()` clears both the cache and the inline `<html>`
overrides (logout / tenant switch).

**Admin UI** — the **Branding** section on `/organization`
(`frontend/src/routes/organization/+page.svelte`): product name, logo URL,
two accent color pickers (native swatch + hex text input), support + legal URLs,
saving via `PUT /api/organization/branding`. Client-side validation mirrors the
backend guards (inline toast on a bad hex / non-http(s) URL). On save it
re-loads the brand store so the sidebar + theme update without a reload.

## Accessibility note

When an org sets a custom accent, that's their choice. The defaults
(`#638cff` / `#3f5fd6`) are the AA-passing tokens documented in `src/app.css`;
the **strong** accent exists specifically as a darker companion so white text on
an accent background clears WCAG 1.4.3 contrast. Orgs are encouraged (UI hint) to
set a darker strong accent for the same reason, but the app does not enforce a
contrast ratio on custom colors in this slice.

## Supplier-portal theming

The supplier portal (`/portal/*`) is a **separate surface** from the employee
app — vendor users (`VendorUser`, JWT `typ=vendor`) authenticate against it with
their own token (`portal_auth_token`), and the **login page is
unauthenticated**. It now carries the tenant's white-label brand (accent colors
+ logo + product name + `<title>`) across the login page AND the authed portal
pages, exactly as the main app does — so a supplier always sees the buyer's
brand, never the platform default.

### The auth-boundary problem — a public brand read

The employee app reads `GET /api/organization/branding`, which is gated to
authenticated org **users** (employees). Vendor users are a *different identity*,
and the portal login is unauthenticated, so neither that endpoint nor a JWT is
available to theme the portal. The portal therefore reads a dedicated,
**public-by-design** endpoint:

`GET /api/portal/branding` (`app/api/portal.py`) — returns the resolved tenant's
`BrandConfig`. Documented public (like the SSO `GET /api/auth/sso/config`
endpoint, and listed in `tests/test_rbac.py::PUBLIC_BY_DESIGN`):

- **Tenant resolution rides the existing chokepoint.** It depends on
  `app.tenant.get_tenant` — the same `X-Tenant-Slug` header / custom-domain
  `Host` resolver every other portal route uses. One tenant's host can never
  return another's brand. Unauthenticated requests are exempt from
  `get_tenant`'s JWT `org`-claim cross-check by design (the cross-check only
  fires for an *employee* token), so the public read works on the login page.
- **Whitelisted fields only — structurally.** The response model **is**
  `BrandConfig`, which carries exactly the six non-sensitive, already-DOM-safe
  white-label fields (`product_name`, `logo_url`, `accent_color`,
  `accent_strong_color`, `support_url`, `legal_url`). No org settings, secrets
  (payment/ERP webhook secrets, extraction/SSO keys), or any other field can
  leak through it — a leakage test asserts the response key-set equals the
  `BrandConfig` whitelist. There is no enumeration surface: the resolver returns
  the one tenant the request already targets, and an unknown tenant is the same
  `404` as everywhere else.
- **Fail-soft.** It reuses `organization._resolve_brand` (the same validated
  parse the admin read/write path uses). The stored values were validated on
  write; a persisted-but-now-invalid block is re-validated here and falls back
  to all-empty (= platform defaults), so the portal always themes and never
  500s. No migration — brand lives in `Organization.settings.brand` JSONB.

### Frontend — the portal brand store

`frontend/src/lib/stores/portalBrand.svelte.ts` is the portal counterpart of the
employee `brand` store. It reads the public `GET /api/portal/branding` over
`portalApi` (rather than the JWT-gated `api`), and shares the **pure** theming
helpers (`brandThemeVars`, `isValidHexColor`) with the employee store via
`brandTheme.ts` — the accent-application + fallback logic is never duplicated.

The portal layout (`frontend/src/routes/portal/+layout.svelte`) runs an
`$effect` that calls `portalBrand.ensureLoadedAndApply()` once a tenant is
resolved (gated only on the tenant, not on auth, so it runs on the login page).
`applyTheme()` writes `--accent` / `--accent-strong` onto
`document.documentElement` only for valid configured colors (an unset/malformed
color leaves the AA-passing `app.css` token standing). The portal header renders
the tenant logo (when set) + product name; the `<title>` is
`{productName} — Supplier Portal`; and the login card
(`frontend/src/routes/portal/login/+page.svelte`) shows the logo + product-name
heading. Fail-soft: any fetch failure degrades to the platform default theme.

The brand is keyed to the **tenant** (subdomain/Host), not the session, so
logout does not reset it — the login page the supplier lands on keeps the
buyer's theme.

### Tests

- Backend: `backend/tests/test_portal_branding.py` (realdb) — the public read is
  anonymous-accessible; returns ONLY the `BrandConfig` whitelist (the leakage
  guard, with sensitive `payments`/`extraction`/`sso` settings present in the
  org row to prove they never surface); fail-soft empty when unset; tolerates a
  malformed persisted brand block (no 500); and is tenant-scoped (tenant A's
  request never returns B's brand).
- Frontend: `frontend/tests-e2e/portal/branding.spec.ts` — sets a known brand
  via the admin `PUT /api/organization/branding` then asserts the portal login
  applies the accent (`--accent`/`--accent-strong` on `<html>`) + the
  product-name heading + `<title>` + the logo `<img>`.

## Branded outbound surfaces (PDFs + emails)

All outbound surfaces resolve brand through **one** helper —
`backend/app/services/branding.py::get_brand_context(org_settings)` — which
returns a frozen `BrandContext` (product name, logo URL, accent color, support /
legal URLs) with platform defaults baked in. It is **pure + total**: tolerates a
`None` settings dict, a missing / non-dict `brand` block, and individually
malformed fields (each falls back to its platform default for text/accent, or to
empty for URLs), and never touches the network. Platform defaults: product name
**"FeohLedger"**, accent **`#638cff`** (kept in sync with the frontend
`app.css` token).

### PDFs

`remittance_pdf.py`, `tax_1099_forms.py`, `audit_report_pdf.py`, and
`analytics_report_pdf.py` each take a resolved `BrandContext` on their render
context (defaulting to the platform brand so an old call site still renders) and
draw a branded header — the tenant **logo** when one is configured and
embeddable, otherwise the tenant **product name** in the **accent color**. The
remittance footer also appends the tenant's support URL when set.

### Analytics report exports (CSV + PDF)

The analytics export surface — `GET /api/analytics/export/{report}` for
`invoice_register` / `vendor_spend` / `payment_register` / `aging_snapshot` /
`cashflow_forecast` — is white-label branded through the same
`get_brand_context` helper. The endpoint takes a `format` query param
(`csv` default | `pdf`); RBAC + tenant-scoping are unchanged
(admin/ap_manager/cfo, entity-scoped).

- **PDF** (`?format=pdf`) — `services/analytics_report_pdf.render_analytics_report_pdf`
  renders a branded, landscape, tabular PDF: a header with the tenant logo (when
  configured + embeddable, via the shared size/time-bounded `build_logo_flowable`,
  fail-soft to the product-name text in the accent color), the report title /
  org / period / generated-at, then the data table. It re-parses the CSV the
  exporter already produced into header + rows, so the PDF renders **exactly** the
  same cells the CSV dialect emits — never broader, no PII beyond what the CSV
  already carries.
- **CSV** (default) — CSV has no visual chrome, so branding is a leading
  **provenance comment block**: a handful of `# `-prefixed lines carrying the
  tenant **product name**, the org name, the report name, and the generated-at
  timestamp, prepended ahead of the unchanged data grid
  (`report_export.brand_provenance_header`). A `#`-comment header is the standard
  CSV-export provenance convention — the data grid (column header row + rows) is
  byte-for-byte the same as before, so it still parses column-positionally: a
  consumer that doesn't recognise comments skips the leading `#` lines
  (`csv.reader` yields them as single-cell rows; pandas takes `comment="#"`). The
  org name (the only tenant-supplied field in the block) is CR/LF-stripped so it
  can't inject a fake row. PII-free: product name + org + report + timestamp only.
  The pure per-report exporters in `report_export.py` are unchanged — the brand
  block is composed in the route, so passing `brand=None` keeps the legacy
  byte-for-byte output.

**Logo embed is best-effort and bounded** (`fetch_logo_bytes` /
`build_logo_flowable`): the fetch is time-bounded (`LOGO_FETCH_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`,
3s) and size-bounded (`LOGO_MAX_BYTES`, 1 MiB, enforced both via the
`Content-Length` header and a hard cap on the streamed bytes), only `http(s)`
URLs are fetched, and **any** failure (no URL, bad scheme, timeout, oversized,
non-2xx, undecodable image) returns `None` so the renderer falls back to the
product-name text. Logo embedding can never break PDF generation, and a dev box
with no network renders fine. Money stays exact and no PII enters the header /
footer (brand chrome only).

### Emails

The `EmailMessage` dataclass carries an optional `brand: BrandContext`. The
email adapters (`console` / `smtp` / `ses`) apply it uniformly via shared
`EmailAdapter` helpers (`_branded_from` / `_branded_html` / `_branded_text`):

- the **From** display name becomes the tenant product name
  (`Acme Pay <no-reply@platform.com>` — the deliverable address is unchanged;
  an address that already has a display name, or is empty, is left alone; the
  name is sanitized of quotes / CR / LF so it can't break the header);
- the **HTML** body is wrapped with a small brand header line (product name in
  the accent color) and a support-link footer (only when a support URL is set);
- the **plaintext** body gets the same support-link footer.

A message with no `brand` set uses the **platform-default** brand, so every
email still presents consistently. The tenant-aware senders that resolve and
pass the brand: `notification_dispatch.notify_event` (invoice-lifecycle emails),
`vendor_notifications.notify_vendor_of_invoice_event` (supplier paid / rejected),
and `supplier_chat.notify_supplier_of_ap_message` (portal chat link). The
control-plane signup / MFA emails fire before a tenant brand exists, so they use
the platform default. Brand resolution for emails is best-effort — a load
failure degrades to the platform brand, never breaking the send.

## Tests

- Backend: `backend/tests/test_branding.py` — schema validation (hex/URL
  guards), admin-only mutate, persistence to `settings.brand`, PII-free audit
  row, 422 on bad hex/URL, 401 without auth, GET readable by any role; **plus**
  `get_brand_context` resolution + platform-default + malformed-field fallback,
  the remittance / 1099 / audit PDFs rendering the product name (+ logo-fetch
  failure falling back to text), and the email adapters branding the From /
  HTML header / support footer. **Analytics exports**:
  `backend/tests/test_report_export.py` (the `brand_provenance_header` block —
  product name + metadata, `None`-brand no-op, the data grid still parsing
  column-positionally below the comment block, org-name newline-injection
  sanitised), `backend/tests/test_analytics_report_pdf.py` (the pure PDF renderer
  — real PDF bytes, configured + default brand, **logo-fetch failure fail-soft**,
  empty rows), and `backend/tests/test_cashflow_forecast_api.py` (the route —
  `format=pdf` content-type + filename, the branded CSV provenance block,
  `format=xlsx` → 422).
- Frontend: `frontend/src/lib/stores/brandTheme.test.ts` — the pure
  color-application / fallback logic (`isValidHexColor`, `brandThemeVars`).

## Custom domains (vanity hostnames)

A tenant can be reached on its own hostname — `ap.acmecorp.com` — instead of (or
in addition to) the `*.localhost` / `<slug>.app.com` subdomain. This is the
white-label "served under the partner's own domain" ask. The TLS certificate and
DNS for the vanity host are **infra** concerns (CloudFront/ALB + ACM + a CNAME to
the platform) and out of scope for the app code; the app's job is purely to map
an inbound request on that host back to the right tenant.

### Storage — no migration

The vanity hostnames live on `Organization.settings.brand.custom_domains`, a JSON
array of bare, lowercase hostnames, e.g.:

```json
{ "brand": { "custom_domains": ["ap.acmecorp.com", "pay.acmecorp.com"] } }
```

Like every other white-label field, this is settings JSONB — **no migration**. A
malformed / non-array `custom_domains` value never breaks resolution (see below).

### Resolution — `app/tenant.py`

`get_tenant_slug` resolves the tenant selector for every request, in order:

1. **Primary** — the `X-Tenant-Slug` header (set by the SPA from the subdomain).
   If present, it is used verbatim and the custom-domain lookup is skipped (no DB
   query).
2. **Fallback** — when the header is absent, the request `Host` header is
   normalized (`normalize_custom_domain`: strip `:port`, lowercase, reject empty /
   IPv6-literal / malformed values) and matched against the per-org
   `settings.brand.custom_domains` array via a JSONB `@>` containment query
   (`resolve_tenant_slug_by_custom_domain`). A match yields the owning org's slug.
3. An unknown/unmatched host (or a malformed settings blob — the lookup catches
   and swallows the error) **falls back to the original 400** "Missing
   X-Tenant-Slug header". It never resolves a wrong tenant and never 500s.

The resolved slug then flows through the **unchanged** `get_tenant` →
`get_tenant_db` chain — the tenant engine is still built only through the existing
`get_tenant_engine(tenant.db_name)` chokepoint, never by a hardcoded DB name.

### Managing the list — admin endpoint + UI

The `custom_domains` list is managed through a dedicated admin endpoint pair
(distinct from `GET/PUT /api/organization/branding`, because `custom_domains`
lives under `settings.brand` but is **not** a `BrandConfig` field):

`GET /api/organization/branding/custom-domains` — returns
`{ "custom_domains": [...] }`. **Read-gated to any authenticated org user**
(same posture as `GET .../branding`) — the resolver reads it too.

`PUT /api/organization/branding/custom-domains` — **admin-only**
(`require_roles(ROLE_ADMIN)`). Full-replace semantics. Each host is normalized
through the **same** `normalize_custom_domain` the resolver uses (strip `:port`,
lowercase, reject empty / IPv6-literal / malformed) — so a stored value can never
diverge from what actually resolves. Malformed entries are rejected (`422`); the
normalized list is de-duplicated.

**Cross-org uniqueness (anti-hijack).** A host already registered to a
*different* org is rejected (`409`). A custom domain is only a *candidate*
tenant selector — the JWT `org`-claim cross-check (below) is what actually gates
access — but letting two orgs claim the same host would make resolution
ambiguous, so it is refused at registration time, queried via the **same** JSONB
containment the resolver uses (so the check and the resolution can't disagree).
Re-saving a host the tenant already owns is **not** a self-conflict. The `409`
body is **generic** ("…already registered to another tenant") — it never echoes
the conflicting hostname back, so it can't confirm to the caller that a specific
host belongs to some other org. The check-and-write is serialized by a
transaction-level `pg_advisory_xact_lock`, so two orgs PUT-ing the same host
concurrently can't both race past the guard (the lock is held to commit and
auto-releases on rollback; no DB constraint is needed since the domains live in
a JSONB array, and admin-config writes are rare enough that one global lock is
cheap).

**This endpoint is the only writer.** `PATCH /api/organization` takes a
free-form `settings` dict and shallow-merges it, so a
`{"brand": {"custom_domains": [...]}}` payload replaced the whole `brand` key
and stored vanity hostnames with **none** of the controls above — no
normalization, no advisory lock, no cross-org uniqueness check, no audit row.
Since anyone can self-signup a tenant and become its admin, that let an
attacker claim a hostname already registered to a victim: with two orgs
matching, `resolve_tenant_slug_by_custom_domain` returned `.scalars().first()`
with no ordering, so requests on that host that carry no `X-Tenant-Slug` — which
is exactly what the SPA sends on a two-label vanity apex — could resolve to the
attacker's org. The unauthenticated `GET /api/portal/branding` would then serve
the *attacker's* product name, logo and support/legal URLs on the victim's own
supplier-portal domain (a ready-made phishing surface aimed at the victim's
suppliers), and `POST /api/portal/auth/login` would resolve to the attacker's
tenant DB so the victim's suppliers could no longer sign in. The JWT
`org`-claim cross-check does not help here: these are the documented
public-by-design routes where it is deliberately skipped.

`PATCH /api/organization` now refuses a `brand.custom_domains` key with a 422
naming this endpoint — the same treatment it already gave `chat_notifications`,
and for the same reason (a second, unaudited writer). The resolver additionally
takes a deterministic `ORDER BY`, so a duplicate that predates the fix resolves
consistently instead of flapping.

Every mutation audits `organization.custom_domains_updated` into the tenant
trail, **PII-free**: it records only the host **count** (old → new), never the
hostnames themselves (tenant infra config kept out of the trail). A branding
save (`PUT .../branding`) **preserves** `custom_domains` — it carries the
existing list forward rather than letting `BrandConfig.model_dump()` wipe it.

**Operator responsibility — DNS + TLS.** Registering a host here only tells the
platform which tenant that host maps to. The vanity host's **DNS** (a CNAME to
the platform edge) and **TLS certificate** (CloudFront/ALB + ACM, or Let's
Encrypt via Caddy on the single-VM shape) are infra, provisioned out of band —
see *Custom domains* intro above. The step-by-step operator procedure for both
deployment shapes — DNS records, certificate issuance + renewal, the CORS env
change, end-to-end verification, rollback and troubleshooting — is
[`docs/founder-runbooks/custom-domain-provisioning.md`](founder-runbooks/custom-domain-provisioning.md).

### The SPA half — `PUBLIC_PLATFORM_DOMAINS`

The backend's `Host` fallback only ever fires when `X-Tenant-Slug` is **absent**,
so the vanity host works or doesn't work depending entirely on what the SPA
decides to send. It used to decide wrong. `getTenantSlug()` took the **first
label of any 3+-label hostname**, which cannot tell a platform subdomain from a
customer's own domain: on `ap.acmecorp.com` (the tenant `acme`) it sent
`X-Tenant-Slug: ap` and every call 404'd `Unknown tenant: ap`, with the `Host`
fallback never reached; on a two-label apex (`acmecorp.com`) it sent no header
but still called the **build-time** `PUBLIC_API_URL` origin, so the backend saw
the platform's `Host`, not the vanity one, and answered the 400. Custom domains
were unreachable from the SPA in both shipped deployment shapes.

The SPA is now **platform-domain aware**. `PUBLIC_PLATFORM_DOMAINS` is a
comma-separated list of the registrable domains the *platform* serves, and
`frontend/src/lib/hostRouting.ts` sorts every hostname into one of four kinds:

| Host | Kind | `X-Tenant-Slug` | API origin |
|---|---|---|---|
| `acme.feohledger.com`, `acme.localhost:7777` | platform tenant | `acme` | build-time `PUBLIC_API_URL` |
| `feohledger.com`, bare `localhost` | platform apex (marketing / signup) | none | build-time `PUBLIC_API_URL` |
| `ap.acmecorp.com`, `acmecorp.com` | **vanity** | **none** | **same origin (`''`)** |
| no `window` (prerender) | unknown | none | build-time `PUBLIC_API_URL` |

Both halves matter and neither is sufficient alone. Sending no header is what
lets the backend's `Host` lookup run at all; calling `/api` **same-origin** is
what puts the *vanity* hostname in the `Host` header for it to look up. A vanity
host that called the build-time API origin would hand the backend the platform's
own hostname and get the 400 anyway. `frontend/src/lib/tenant.ts::getApiBase()`
is the single owner of that decision, resolved per request at **runtime** rather
than frozen into a module constant at build time, and `$lib/api.ts` +
`$lib/portalApi.ts` both read it — there is no second spelling.

**Two things the operator must do**, beyond the DNS + TLS below:

1. **Build the frontend with `PUBLIC_PLATFORM_DOMAINS` set** to the platform's
   own domain(s) — e.g. `PUBLIC_PLATFORM_DOMAINS=feohledger.com pnpm build`. See
   `docs/environment.md`. **Unset is legal and means "the old rule"**: an empty
   list replays the pre-change behaviour byte-for-byte, so an existing build that
   passes only `PUBLIC_API_URL` is unchanged — and custom domains stay
   unreachable from the SPA until the var is set. That default is deliberate: if
   an unset list meant "every host is a vanity host", every deployment would stop
   sending `X-Tenant-Slug` on upgrade and fall back to a `Host` map with no
   entries.
2. **Serve `/api` on the vanity origin.** Because a vanity host calls its own
   origin, the edge terminating `ap.acmecorp.com` must proxy `/api/*` through to
   the backend (CloudFront behaviour / ALB rule, or the `handle_path` block in
   `deploy/Caddyfile` on the single-VM shape). Without it every API call hits the
   static site and 404s. There is no CORS change to make for this path — the
   request is same-origin by construction.

**The hostname is now free-form.** `ap.acmecorp.com` no longer has to be
`<tenant-slug>.<customer-domain>`, because the first label is never read as a
slug on a non-platform host; a two-label apex (`acmecorp.com`) works too. The
one remaining shape rule is the backend's own `normalize_custom_domain` (bare,
lowercase, no port, no IPv6 literal).

**Consequences elsewhere in the SPA.** A vanity host has a tenant but no slug, so
anything that keyed off the slug needs the host instead. `$lib/entity.ts`
partitions its stored multi-entity selection by
`$lib/tenant.ts::getTenantStorageKey()` — the slug on a platform host, the
hostname on a vanity host — rather than by `getTenantSlug()`, which would have
silently disabled entity persistence on every vanity host.

**Admin UI** — the **Custom Domains** section on `/organization`
(`frontend/src/routes/organization/+page.svelte`, below the Branding panel):
lists the current hostnames, adds one (client-side validated to mirror the
backend `normalize_custom_domain`, surfacing a typo inline instead of as a
`422`/`409`), and removes one (armed two-click confirm). Loading / error / empty
states; the operator's DNS+TLS responsibility is called out in the panel hint.

### Trust model — the JWT cross-check still gates everything

This is the load-bearing point. A custom domain resolves only a **candidate**
tenant slug; it does **not** grant access. `get_tenant` still performs the
cross-tenant guard: for an employee JWT (`typ != "vendor"`), the token's `org`
claim **must equal** the resolved Organization's id, or the request is rejected
with `403`. So:

- A forged / leaked `Host: ap.acmecorp.com` header, on its own, can no more widen
  access than a forged `X-Tenant-Slug: acme` header can — both only pick a
  candidate; the JWT org claim is the actual authority. An attacker holding a
  techflow JWT who points a request at acme's vanity host still gets a 403.
- Vendor-portal tokens (`typ="vendor"`) and unauthenticated requests are exempt
  from the cross-check exactly as before (VendorUser rows are tenant-local;
  unauthenticated requests are rejected by the downstream auth dependency). The
  custom-domain fallback changes *how the slug is derived*, not the guard that
  follows it.

In short: custom-domain resolution is a convenience for picking the tenant when
the SPA can't supply the header; it is **not** a new trust boundary, and the
existing tenant-isolation invariant (project invariant #4) is fully preserved.

### Tests

`backend/tests/test_tenant_custom_domain.py` — `normalize_custom_domain`
edge cases (port strip, case-fold, IPv6/malformed reject); the header taking
priority and skipping the DB lookup; a custom domain resolving to the right slug;
unknown domain / no host falling back to 400; a malformed settings blob not
500-ing; and — the security headline — that the JWT `org`-claim cross-check still
rejects a mismatched token on the custom-domain path (and allows a matching one).

`backend/tests/test_custom_domains_admin.py` — the management endpoint: GET
readable by any authed role + 401 without auth; PUT admin-only (403 for a
manager); normalize + de-dupe + persist to `settings.brand.custom_domains`;
PII-free `organization.custom_domains_updated` audit (count only); round-trip
through GET; 422 on a malformed host; clearing the list; **cross-org uniqueness
409** (tenant B claims a host → tenant A is refused, A's list unchanged);
re-registering a host the tenant already owns is fine; and the regression that a
branding save preserves `custom_domains`.

`frontend/tests-e2e/organization/custom-domains.spec.ts` — the panel renders;
adding a host through the UI round-trips through GET; removing one (armed
confirm) drops it; an invalid hostname surfaces an inline error and fires no PUT.

`frontend/src/lib/tenant.test.ts` — the SPA half, over the dependency-free
`$lib/hostRouting.ts`: the four host kinds; a vanity 3-label host and a vanity
apex both yielding **no** slug; the `*.localhost` dev convention and the deployed
platform subdomain still yielding one; longest-platform-domain-first matching;
the API-base resolver (platform host → build-time `PUBLIC_API_URL`, vanity host →
same origin); the per-tenant storage key; and — the upgrade guard — that an unset
`PUBLIC_PLATFORM_DOMAINS` replays the pre-change rule exactly.
`frontend/src/lib/tenantSlugUsage.test.ts` adds two whole-tree scans: nothing
outside `hostRouting.ts` splits a hostname into labels, and nothing outside
`tenant.ts` imports the build-time `PUBLIC_API_URL` (bar a ratcheted two-file
baseline), so a second spelling of either rule can't reappear.

`frontend/tests-e2e/tenant/vanity-host.spec.ts` — the platform-host half
end-to-end: every `/api` call from `<slug>.localhost:7777` still carries
`X-Tenant-Slug: <slug>` and still targets the build-time API origin rather than
collapsing to same-origin. The **vanity** half is deliberately unit-only: the
e2e harness can neither guarantee `PUBLIC_PLATFORM_DOMAINS` reaches both run
modes (local `pnpm dev` reads `.env.development`; CI serves a production-mode
`vite build` that does not) nor serve a second hostname that terminates both the
SPA and `/api`. The spec's header records exactly what would unlock it.

## Partner / reseller admin

A **partner** (reseller) org administers a set of branded **child** tenants —
white-labeling a workspace and then operating its sub-tenants' branding under
one parent account. This is the "one partner manages many branded tenants" ask.

### The relationship — a control-plane self-FK

Orgs live in the **control plane**, so the parent/child link is a nullable
self-referential FK on `Organization`: **`parent_org_id`** (migration `0065`,
control-plane-only). When set, that org is a branded **child** administered by
its parent; NULL = a standalone tenant.

A "partner" is **derived, not flagged** — it is simply any org referenced as a
`parent_org_id` by ≥ 1 child. There is no separate `is_partner` column an admin
could flip to claim children it didn't actually parent. The link is now
**created in-app** via the provisioning flow below (no raw DB statement needed) —
see *Provisioning the link* — guarded so a partner can only attach a tenant that
explicitly consented.

The migration is control-plane-only (gated on the `organizations` table
existing, exactly like `0062`/`0055`) — it does **not** fan out to tenant DBs;
`organizations` never exists in a tenant DB. The FK uses `ON DELETE SET NULL`, so
deleting a partner org orphans its children back to standalone rather than
cascading a delete.

### Backend — `/api/partner` (`backend/app/api/partner.py`)

Three admin-only (`require_roles(ROLE_ADMIN)`), JWT-gated endpoints on the
control-plane `organizations` table:

`GET /api/partner` — the caller's partner overview: its identity + the child
tenants it administers (`PartnerOverview` → `is_partner` + `children[]`, each
carrying id / name / slug / plan / the child's resolved white-label
`product_name`). A standalone org gets `is_partner: false` + an empty list (a
state the UI renders, not an error).

`GET /api/partner/children/{child_id}/branding` — read one child's `BrandConfig`
(reuses `organization._resolve_brand`, tolerant of a missing/malformed block →
platform defaults).

`PUT /api/partner/children/{child_id}/branding` — push a child's branding.
Pydantic validates the payload (hex colors, http(s) URLs); the write lands on the
**child** org's `settings.brand` (control plane) and **preserves**
`custom_domains` (the same carry-forward the child's own `PUT
/api/organization/branding` does, so a partner save can't wipe the child's vanity
hostnames). Audited into the **child's** tenant trail as
`organization.branding_updated` with `via: "partner"` + the acting
`partner_org_id` — **PII-free** (which fields are now set, booleans only; never a
raw value).

### Provisioning the link — two-sided consent (attach + detach)

The partner surface now **creates** the parent/child link, not just administers
an existing one. Three more admin-only endpoints
(`require_roles(ROLE_ADMIN)`, JWT-gated via `get_tenant`):

`POST /api/partner/link-code` — mint a **single-use link code** FOR the caller's
**own** org. Handing that code to a prospective partner IS the act of consenting
to be adopted. Returns `{link_code, expires_in_minutes}`. The code is an HMAC-
signed token (`backend/app/services/partner_link_token.py`, pure, modelled on the
email-action token) over the caller's org id only — **no name/slug/PII** — with a
short TTL (`FEOH_PARTNER_LINK_TTL_MINUTES`, default 30). A **503** when no signing
key is configured (feature off). Issuing is audited PII-free
(`partner.link_code_issued`).

`POST /api/partner/children` — the partner's admin **redeems** a child-issued
code to attach that child. The signature is verified first (an invalid / expired
/ wrong-purpose / cross-key code is one opaque **400** — no enumeration), then the
`jti` is claimed **single-use** in Redis (fail-closed — a Redis blip rejects
rather than risk a replay). Guards: a child already linked to a parent is a **409**
(no silent takeover; re-linking to the *same* partner is the idempotent no-op,
201), and an org can't adopt itself (400). On success `child.parent_org_id` is
set and the change is audited on **both** trails (`partner.child_attached` on the
partner's, `partner.parent_linked` on the child's — org ids only).

`DELETE /api/partner/children/{child_id}` — detach a child (back to standalone,
`parent_org_id = NULL`). Scoped at the data layer to the caller's own children
via `_resolve_child` (a non-child / unknown id is the same opaque **404**).
Idempotent (a second detach is a clean 404 — the link is already gone). Audited
on both trails (`partner.child_detached` / `partner.parent_unlinked`).

`POST /api/partner/children/provision` — provision a brand-**NEW** child tenant
already parented to the caller (the new-tenant counterpart of `attach_child`,
which adopts an *existing* consenting org). Admin-only. Body mirrors
`scripts/create_tenant.py`: `{name, slug, admin_email}` (`admin_name`/`plan`
optional) — there is **no `parent_org_id` input**; the new tenant is ALWAYS
parented to `org.id` from the `get_tenant` chokepoint, so a partner can only ever
create a child UNDER ITSELF. Flow: validate the admin-email shape + the slug
(format + reserved-word + availability, same `utils/slug` checks signup uses) →
provision the full tenant via the shared
`services/tenant_provisioning.provision_tenant` primitive (control-plane org +
admin user + the `feoh_<slug>` tenant DB + tables) → stamp `parent_org_id = org.id`
→ audit `partner.child_provisioned` on the partner's trail + `partner.parent_linked`
(`via:provision`) on the new child's, PII-free (org ids + slug only, never the
admin email or password). **Failure path is clean** — `provision_tenant` owns the
orphan-DB rollback (it drops the `feoh_<slug>` DB it created on any partial
failure), so we never half-create; a slug that races past the pre-check trips the
unique constraint inside provisioning → a clean **409** (not a 500). An invalid
slug is **422**, a taken slug **409** (the only enumeration surface is the
partner's *own* choice of slug, which public signup already exposes — not a
cross-tenant leak). Returns the `ChildTenantSummary` plus the new admin's
`admin_email` + a one-time `temp_password` (returned EXACTLY once, like an API-key
mint — the new admin rotates it on first login via `must_change_password`). No
migration (the `parent_org_id` column already exists).

**Why this authorization model is safe (the privilege boundary).** The hard
question attach poses: who may declare org X a child of partner P? Letting any
partner admin unilaterally adopt an arbitrary org would be a cross-tenant
takeover. There is also **no platform-operator / superuser identity** in this
app — every user is org-scoped — so a pure "operator grants the link" path has no
actor to run it. The durable answer is **two-sided consent**: the prospective
child's *own* admin must first mint a link code (proof of consent); the partner's
admin then redeems it. Because the platform holds the signing key (sops + KMS in
deployed envs; a NON-secret value committed in `.env.development`), a partner
**cannot forge a code or aim it at an org that never consented** — an attach with
no/garbage/forged code is rejected and no link is created. The key's presence is
the single on/off knob (`FEOH_PARTNER_LINK_SIGNING_KEY`), fail-closed with no
hardcoded fallback. The link is a control-plane write only; no migration was
needed (the `parent_org_id` column already exists).

### Trust model — isolation at the data layer

This is the load-bearing point and it composes with the existing tenant-isolation
invariant:

- The caller's org is resolved by the standard **`get_tenant`** chokepoint, which
  cross-checks the JWT `org` claim against the resolved tenant — so a partner
  admin authenticates as, and can only act as, *their own* partner org. A
  swapped `X-Tenant-Slug` or forged `Host` can't widen that (same guard as
  everywhere else).
- EVERY child query is then scoped at the data layer:
  `Organization.parent_org_id == <caller org id>` (in
  `partner._resolve_child`'s WHERE clause, not in post-hoc app code). A partner
  can never read or mutate an org it didn't parent.
- A non-child (or unknown) `child_id` is the **same opaque 404** as a missing
  one — no cross-tenant enumeration of org ids.

So a partner holding org A's JWT pointing at org B's id gets a `404`; only orgs
whose `parent_org_id` is A are reachable. Branding pushed to a child is audited in
*that child's* trail, attributable to the partner.

### Frontend — `/admin/partner`

The **Partner Admin** page (`frontend/src/routes/admin/partner/+page.svelte`,
under the Settings nav group, admin-gated — non-admins redirect to `/`, the
backend 403s them regardless). Lists the partner's child tenants (`DataTable`,
clickable rows) and opens a `Modal` to view/edit a child's brand (product name,
logo URL, two accent colors, support + legal URLs) with the same client-side
hex/URL validation as the org's own Branding panel, saving via `PUT
/api/partner/children/{id}/branding`. A standalone org renders the empty
"not a partner" state. API client: `frontend/src/lib/api/partner.ts` (types in
`frontend/src/lib/types/partner.ts`). Built from the shared `ui/` components.

The page also carries the **provisioning** affordances: a **Generate link code**
panel ("Join a partner" — this workspace consenting to *be* a child; copies the
minted code), a **+ Create child tenant** toolbar button opening a `Modal` to
provision a brand-new tenant under this partner (name / slug / admin email →
`POST /api/partner/children/provision`; the result view reveals the one-time temp
password with a copy button, shown only once), an **+ Attach child** toolbar
button opening a `Modal` to paste a child-issued code (`POST /api/partner/children`),
and an armed two-click **Detach** `RowAction` per child row
(`DELETE /api/partner/children/{id}`).

### Tests

- Backend: `backend/tests/test_partner_admin.py` (realdb) — overview lists ONLY
  the caller's own children; a standalone org is `is_partner:false` + empty;
  admin-only (403 for a manager) + 401 unauth; read + push a child's branding;
  push persists to the child's row, audits the child's trail PII-free
  (`via:partner`, raw value never echoed), and preserves the child's
  `custom_domains`; **the isolation headline** — a non-child org id is an opaque
  404 on both read and write, and the non-child's brand is untouched.
- Backend (provisioning): `backend/tests/test_partner_link_token.py` (pure —
  build/verify round-trip, fail-closed on empty key, forgery/tamper rejection,
  purpose binding, expiry) + `backend/tests/test_partner_link_provisioning.py`
  (realdb — mint admin-only/fail-closed; attach with a consenting code links +
  audits both trails PII-free; **the authorization headline**: attach with no /
  garbage / cross-key-forged code is rejected and NO link is created; single-use
  replay → 409; re-parent guard → 409 with same-partner idempotent no-op; detach
  unlinks + audits, non-child opaque 404, admin-only).
- Backend (new-tenant provisioning): `backend/tests/test_partner_provision.py`
  (realdb — provisioning creates the org + tenant DB and stamps
  `parent_org_id = caller`; the child appears in the partner overview; both
  trails audited PII-free (`child_provisioned`/`parent_linked`, never the admin
  email or temp password); admin-only (403) + 401 unauth; slug collision → clean
  409 with the existing tenant undisturbed; invalid slug / email → 422. Each test
  drops the provisioned DB + control rows in a `finally`).
- Frontend: `frontend/tests-e2e/admin/partner.spec.ts` (branding admin surface) +
  `frontend/tests-e2e/admin/partner-provisioning.spec.ts` — admin sees the
  attach + link-code affordances and mints a code; the authorization boundary
  (a garbage code is an opaque 400, no link created; a self-mint can't self-
  attach); a clerk is 403'd on mint + attach.

## Deferred to later slices

- The operational runbook for the TLS-cert + DNS provisioning that pairs with a
  registered custom domain (the app-side `custom_domains` admin UI + endpoint
  pair shipped — see *Managing the list* above; the infra automation that issues
  the ACM cert and wires the CNAME is a separate, infra-owned slice).
- **Self-service "create a *new* child tenant under my partner account"** —
  **shipped.** `POST /api/partner/children/provision` (see *Provisioning the
  link* above) is the thin wrapper over
  `services/tenant_provisioning.provision_tenant` that stamps `parent_org_id` +
  audits both trails, reusing the same admin gate; the `/admin/partner` panel's
  **+ Create child tenant** modal drives it. A partner can now spin up a
  net-new branded tenant already parented to it in one step (the new-tenant
  counterpart of the attach/detach provisioning of *existing* tenants). No
  migration (the `parent_org_id` column already exists). The DNS/TLS automation
  for the new tenant's custom vanity domain is still the separate infra-owned
  slice noted above (the app-side custom-domain registration works today).
