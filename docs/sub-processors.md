# Sub-processor register

A **sub-processor** is any third party that processes personal or financial
data on our behalf when our customers (the *controllers*) use the platform.
GDPR Art. 28(2)–(4) requires us to keep an accurate, up-to-date list of every
sub-processor, the data they touch, and where they process it, and to flow our
Data Processing Agreement (DPA) obligations down to each of them.

This register is the source of truth for that list. Keep it accurate: it feeds
the sub-processor schedule in the customer DPA
(`docs/founder-runbooks/dpa-template.md`, owned separately), the SOC 2 vendor-management module (`docs/founder-runbooks/soc2-vendor.md`
§ Step 6), and the Records of Processing Activities (`docs/ropa.md`).

- `docs/founder-runbooks/breach-notification.md` — what to do if a
  sub-processor reports (or causes) a personal-data breach.

  pluggable provider and its default.

## The local-first design — read this first

**A default install of this platform shares personal/financial data with NO
external sub-processor.** Every external integration is a *pluggable adapter*
behind a registry, and every adapter category ships a `mock` / `console` /
local in-process default. With the shipped defaults:

- AI extraction runs against a local/`mock` adapter (no invoice image leaves
  the box; the committed dev default for the conversational assistant is a
  **local Ollama** model, falling back to `mock`).
- ERP, virtual-card, payment, FX, sanctions/KYC, PEPPOL, audit-shipping, and
  embedding integrations all default to `mock` (in-process, deterministic, no
  network, no credential).
- Outbound email defaults to the `console` adapter (logs to stdout — nothing
  sent).
- Files live in MinIO and databases in local PostgreSQL via Docker Compose —
  no AWS account required.

A provider only becomes an **active sub-processor** when an operator (or an
individual tenant, via `Organization.settings`) explicitly configures it with a
live credential. The platform refuses to silently activate a real provider:
secrets live only in `*.sops` files (AWS KMS-encrypted) or deployed env, and
adapters with no key **fail closed** to their local default rather than calling
out.

The **"Active when configured"** column below makes this explicit. A row marked
"Configured only" is *latent* — present in the codebase, dormant until someone
turns it on. The infra rows (AWS) are the exception: a real deployment runs on
AWS by design, so those are active in any deployed environment.

When you assess our sub-processor exposure for a given customer, the honest
answer is **"which adapters has this tenant / this deployment actually enabled"**
— not the full list below.

## Data-category legend

| Code | Category |
|------|----------|
| **INV** | Invoice content — line items, amounts, descriptions, dates, invoice/PO numbers |
| **VEND** | Vendor/supplier master data — legal name, address, contact, vendor code |
| **BANK** | Banking / payment-method data — account & routing numbers, IBAN, card PAN |
| **TAX** | Tax identifiers — EIN/SSN/VAT/TIN, W-9/W-8 forms |
| **USER** | Platform user identity — name, email, auth metadata |
| **AUTH** | Authentication artifacts — credentials, SSO/SAML assertions, MFA secrets |
| **AUDIT** | Audit-log events (actor id, action, entity id; field *names*, never values) |
| **DOC** | Uploaded documents / file bytes (invoice PDFs, receipts, contracts, tax forms) |
| **COMMS** | Communications content — email bodies, supplier-chat messages |

Banking/PAN and raw tax-ID values are deliberately minimized: the platform
stores only redacted forms (e.g. `account_last4`, TIN last-4) in the database;
full values exist only in the encrypted payment file or are passed transiently
to the relevant processor at the moment of use. See root `CLAUDE.md` §
"Project invariants" (PII/banking data stays out of logs).

## 16. Infrastructure — Amazon Web Services (AWS)

AWS is the **infrastructure sub-processor** for any deployed environment. Unlike
the adapter rows above, AWS is active in every real deployment by design (local
dev runs entirely on Docker Compose + MinIO + PostgreSQL with no AWS account).
See `docs/production-deployment.md` for the full architecture and
`docs/data-residency.md` for region placement.

| AWS service | Role in the platform | Data categories | Processing location | DPA / sub-processing status |
|-------------|----------------------|-----------------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| **RDS for PostgreSQL** (control plane + per-tenant DBs) | Primary application datastore | INV, VEND, BANK (redacted), TAX (redacted), USER, AUTH, AUDIT | Configured AWS region | Covered by **AWS GDPR DPA** (standard) |
| **S3** (invoice/receipt/contract files, Positive Pay files, audit archive) | Object storage (MinIO equivalent in prod) | DOC, BANK (Positive Pay file holds full account/routing) | Configured AWS region | AWS GDPR DPA |
| **KMS** | Secrets + at-rest encryption keys (SOPS, RDS, S3) | none (key material only) | Configured AWS region | AWS GDPR DPA |
| **SQS** | Async job queues (extraction / ERP / audit in `lambda` mode) | INV, VEND, DOC (job payloads) | Configured AWS region | AWS GDPR DPA |
| **Lambda** | Async workers (extraction, ERP, audit) | INV, VEND, DOC | Configured AWS region | AWS GDPR DPA |
| **CloudFront** | CDN for the static frontend | none (static assets; no personal data in the bundle) | Global edge | AWS GDPR DPA |
| **ALB** | API load balancer | metadata only (IPs, headers in transit) | Configured AWS region | AWS GDPR DPA |
| **ECS / Fargate** | FastAPI API runtime | all in-transit categories | Configured AWS region | AWS GDPR DPA |
| **ElastiCache (Redis)** | JWT blocklist, rate-limit counters, MFA email-OTP hashes | USER, AUTH (short-lived) | Configured AWS region | AWS GDPR DPA |
| **CloudWatch Logs** | App + audit logs | AUDIT, USER (no PII values by design) | Configured AWS region | AWS GDPR DPA |
| **SES** | Transactional + inbound intake email (when configured) | USER, COMMS, DOC | Configured AWS region | AWS GDPR DPA |
| **Route 53** | DNS | none | Global | AWS GDPR DPA |

> The single AWS DPA / GDPR addendum covers all the AWS services above. Confirm
> it is countersigned and that the configured region(s) match the commitments in
> `docs/data-residency.md`.

## Maintenance

- **When to update**: any time an adapter is added/removed, a new external
  provider is configured for an operator-managed deployment, a processing
  region changes, or a DPA status is confirmed. Per the project's docs-as-code
  rule, the same change that wires up a provider updates this register.
- **"To be confirmed"** entries are placeholders for the founder/legal to fill
  as DPAs are countersigned — they are not "no DPA", just "not yet recorded
  here". Drive each to a real status (`docs/founder-runbooks/soc2-vendor.md`
  § Step 6 vendor risk reviews is the natural place to do it).
- **Customer notice**: GDPR Art. 28(2) requires giving controllers advance
  notice and a chance to object before adding a new sub-processor. When a new
  active sub-processor is introduced to a shared/multi-tenant deployment, notify
  affected customers per the DPA's change procedure.
