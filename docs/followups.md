# Open follow-ups

**Open items only.** Completed items are pruned as they land — the code is in
git history and the reasoning belongs in [decisions.md](decisions.md). This file
should shrink as often as it grows.

Every item here is one of:

- **(a)** blocked on an external credential, account, vendor engagement, or
  hardware we don't have;
- **(b)** an operator step on code that is already merged;
- **(c)** a sized-but-unstarted piece of work, or a deferred-with-reason finding
  awaiting a product or architecture call.

This is the destination root `CLAUDE.md` guard rail 6 demands for a deferral —
"deferred / recommended" in a report is a staging area, not an end state. An
item lands here **with its category, the durable fix, and the trigger to do it**,
or it doesn't get deferred.

**What does not belong here:**

| That | Goes here |
|---|---|
| Diagnosed defects with a root cause | [known-issues.md](known-issues.md) |
| Scope + status of work still open | [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) |
| Scope of work already shipped | [roadmap_shipped.md](roadmap_shipped.md) |
| Why something was built the way it was | [decisions.md](decisions.md) |

Each open roadmap section carries an `**Open:**` line naming what's left; the
matching entry here carries the category, durable fix, and trigger. Keep the
pair consistent — if an item leaves this file, its roadmap section either loses
its `**Open:**` line or moves to the archive.

Mirrored as GitHub issue [#321](https://github.com/Absence0760/project-account-payables/issues/321)
for the tracker view. Keep the two reconciled when either moves.

**Last reconciled:** 2026-08-19 against round 12 — a five-agent sweep of the
open follow-up backlog itself (money path, vendors/procurement/expenses,
multi-currency/e-invoicing/async, ingest/reports/AI, and the frontend), plus a
sixth pass landing the backend legs the frontend work was written against. The
backlog went from 75 open items to 21; the calls each agent had to make are
recorded in [decisions.md](decisions.md) §36-§49.

Before that: 2026-08-18 against round 10 — a five-agent bug hunt.
Each agent fixed its findings at the root with a reproducing test first, and
recorded what it confirmed but did not fix in its own section below. The pass
is **additive**: nothing pre-existing was closed or re-verified, so every
earlier entry stands as it was left on 2026-08-17.

Before that: 2026-08-17 against `fix/bug-hunt-round-9` — a five-agent
bug hunt that confirmed ~50 findings and fixed 31 at the root (see § Surfaced by
the five-agent bug hunt for the remainder, which is the largest single addition
this file has taken).

Before that, against round 8 (`feat: round 8 — exact money serialization,
bulk-intake bounds, and the dependency backlog`, #312) plus one same-day
follow-up. Round 8 closed every `(c)` entry that had been sitting in
§ "Surfaced while closing the above, deliberately not fixed" — money is now
exact throughout `api/analytics.py` (the `float()` calls remaining there are
`dpo`/`*_pct` and day-count fields, never money), every expense `Numeric` field
is digit/scale-bounded, `chat_notifications.webhook_url` has an audited rotation
endpoint, and `notification_dispatch._send_chat_best_effort` no longer names
the invoice id `entity_id`. The follow-up closed the section's last two: a
hint on the `/cfo` DPO trend chart naming its own closed-months window, and
`frontend/tests-e2e/organization/data-residency.spec.ts` (the Data Residency
panel's missing e2e coverage, modeled on the sibling Custom Domains spec).
That empties the section, so it's removed rather than kept as a "— CLOSED"
stub.

Before that: 2026-08-16 against `improve/round-batch-3` — a three-agent
round that closed **every remaining actionable `(c)` item**. What is left in
this file is the `(a)` credential-blocked set, the `(b)` operator steps, and two
`(c)` entries that are product calls rather than work (an unwired adapter family
and the copilot's saved-plans bucket), plus the badge-spelling consistency
sweep.

A later backend round added one more `(c)` entry — eight built-and-documented
capabilities with no production caller — found while closing the
adapter-registry defect behind [decisions §29](decisions.md). That round did
close the sharp half of the same survey: all three money-touching dispatchers
(payments, ERP, FX) resolved an unrecognised provider name to their **fixture**
adapter, which is not an inert stub — `mock.create_payment` reports every
payment settled, `mock.parse_webhook` verifies no signature, `mock.post_invoice`
returns a fabricated ERP document id, and the mock FX rate got *locked onto the
Payment row* — so one typo in an admin-entered settings value silently produced
paid-but-unpaid invoices, an unverified public webhook parser, ERP references
pointing at nothing, and a permanently mis-priced outflow. All three now fail
closed, with each caller deciding what the refusal means.

**The vendor-statement upload UI closed** — but the entry's premise ("no file
picker at all") was stale; a picker existed and already took CSV and PDF. The
real defects were sharper: the two intakes competed silently (a file beat typed
lines, and `notes` was dropped on the upload path the endpoint doesn't accept it
on), the backend's PII-free 422 refusals — the actionable half of a reader that
*skips rather than guesses* — went to a fading toast, `has_source_file` /
`extraction` were never typed client-side, and an empty pasted editor created a
run asserting the supplier had listed nothing. Intake is now an explicit mode
choice, refusals render as a persistent inline alert, and the run detail carries
a source pill, the `extraction` provenance block and a download of the archived
supplier document. That was the last open item in the Vendor Statement
Reconciliation roadmap section, which moved to
[roadmap_shipped.md](roadmap_shipped.md). It surfaced two new items — the
keyless-dev-box extraction fallback, and the reader's uncounted skipped rows —
**both of which are now closed too** (see the extraction paragraph below).

**The invoices/vendors local-mutation race closed** — the fix went into the
shared `createRequestSequencer()` primitive rather than being hand-rolled per
page, splitting the old single `isLatest` predicate into `canCommit` (may this
response be written?) and `isCurrentRequest` (is this still the newest request?)
so a `finally` clearing a loading flag doesn't hang forever once a local edit
supersedes an in-flight fetch. Rationale in [decisions.md](decisions.md) §23.
The exhaustive sweep it prompted found the far larger remainder — eighteen list
surfaces with no sequencing at all — and a separate `/assistant` defect.

**Both of those are now closed too**, in the frontend round that had the whole
app to itself. Every list store and list route named in that sweep is on the
shared primitive, `InvoiceModal`'s line-item editor and the `workflows/[id]`
canvas with it (an editor over a fetched list loses unsaved work, not just a
row), and the issue-#168 `untrack` fix reached the eight filter pages that
never got it — `syncUrl()` is untracked wholesale there, since it writes URL
state and is not a dependency source. `/assistant` now holds `busy` for the
whole conversation load *and* resolves its in-flight bubble by identity rather
than by a captured index, so a replaced array can't misdirect the model's
answer onto an unrelated historical message; `/cash-flow`'s copy of the same
code got the identity half so it isn't the version copied from next. The
per-list (not per-file) sequencer rule, the untracked-writer rule and the
identity rule are in [decisions.md](decisions.md) §25; the pattern doc is
`frontend/CLAUDE.md` § Sequencing list fetches. Guards:
`tests-e2e/reactivity/local-edit-vs-inflight-fetch.spec.ts`,
`tests-e2e/assistant/thread-load-race.spec.ts`, and `/recurring` joining the
existing `search-debounce-race.spec.ts` table.

**The ERP sync-back's failures became visible and recoverable** —
`services/payment_erp_sync` is the only path that flips an invoice
`payment_scheduled → paid`, is dispatched one-shot after a terminal event and is
never re-invoked for an already-`completed` payment, so a failed leg left the
money moved and the invoice stranded forever behind a log line. Worse, one
shared transaction meant a leg failing on a DB error rolled back the run's
*successful* transitions too. Each leg now commits independently, every failure
opens a de-duped PII-free `erp_reconciliation` exception, and
`POST /api/payments/runs/{run_id}/sync-erp` is the audited retry exit.
Rationale in [decisions.md](decisions.md) §22. Two sibling fixes rode along (a
fail-open `quote_payment` base default, and a head-of-line stall in
`vendor_rescreen`); the systemic remainder — every sweep discarding its own
failure count — became its own entry, **now closed** (next paragraph).

**Every background sweep's failure count became state.** All fourteen
long-lived sweeps carried a private copy of the same loop body and discarded the
result their `*_once()` returned; twelve of those results already carried a
`failures: int` that nothing read. There was no supervision either
(`asyncio.create_task` with no `add_done_callback`), so a sweep whose loop died
was gone for the life of the process with nothing saying so — an
`audit_shipping` sink misconfigured for months, its SOC 2 WORM evidence never
leaving the tenant DB, looked exactly like one running clean. The fix is the
single mechanism the entry asked for rather than fourteen ad-hoc ones:
`services/sweep_health.py` owns the loop *body* (`run_sweep_loop`), so the
outcome is recorded by construction and the bodies can't drift again. A tick
that completes reporting `failures > 0` counts as failed — modelling only "did
it raise" would have left the motivating case invisible — and a tick that hangs
inside `*_once` is reported `stalled` rather than sitting in `running` looking
healthy. Supervision goes through `start_sweep()`, with an AST scan failing the
suite if a raw `create_task` returns. Admin-gated `GET /api/health/sweeps`
reports it; public `GET /api/health` is unchanged, deliberately, so a
misconfigured sink can't become a rolling restart loop. Rationale in
[decisions.md](decisions.md) §24. It also fixed a real PII leak found along the
way: eight loops passed `exc_info=True` / `logger.exception`, which appends the
whole traceback regardless of the format string — `payment_reconciler` had
diagnosed that in a comment and fixed it for itself alone.

**Platform extraction stopped calling out from a keyless dev box, and the
statement reader started admitting what it refuses.**
`_resolve_extraction_config` hardcoded `claude_vision` for platform mode — the
default for every seeded tenant — *regardless* of whether
`FEOH_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` was set, so a fresh clone POSTed to `api.anthropic.com`
with an empty key on every extraction, breaking guard rail 7 for the whole
extraction path rather than just statements. The new pure
`resolve_platform_provider` resolves explicit `FEOH_EXTRACTION_PROVIDER` → a
configured key → `claude_vision` (the deployed path, byte-identical) → keyless
and non-deployed → `mock`. A keyless *deployed* env deliberately does **not**
fall back: `mock.extract` returns a fabricated invoice at 0.95 confidence, inside
the band that can auto-approve, so a lost credential would start booking invented
payables against real vendors. An unregistered `FEOH_EXTRACTION_PROVIDER` is
refused at boot, because the dispatcher silently falls back to `mock` on an
unknown name and the new env var would otherwise have made a typo a route to the
fixture adapter. Rationale in [decisions.md](decisions.md) §26. Separately,
`scan_statement_text` now classifies each skip where it happens — "not a row"
(blank lines, headers, page furniture, subtotals) stays silent, "ambiguous"
(a second money column, a second reference column) is counted and surfaced
through `meta.extraction` — which is the honest split the entry said was the
actual design problem: a clean statement reports 0, an aging statement reports
one per data row. Building it surfaced a pre-existing mis-accept, where
`Current: 1,200.00  Past due: 850.00` was booked as an open item with invoice
number `1,200.00`; that is fixed, and the refusal is announced rather than
silent whenever the row has an open item's shape.

**Two reporting gaps closed with them.** `/cfo` now distinguishes "we have a
bank balance but declined to use it" (`opening_balance_provider_skipped`, e.g.
`currency_mismatch`) from "no bank is connected" — the API already carried the
reason and the page rendered only `source === 'none'`, so the two looked
identical on the surface where the number is actually read. And the axe
accessibility guard gained all four `/admin` routes plus `/vendor-statements`
(list and create modal) — the surface carrying dialogs, armed two-click
destructive actions and one-time secret reveals, which is exactly where a
focus-management regression is most costly and where the guard was silent.

**The axe route list stopped trailing the app — by not being the only guard.**
Its entry asked two things: add four more routes, and *consider* whether a
token-pairing lint beats route-by-route coverage for this class. Both are done,
and the second turned out to be the whole answer. Scanning the stylesheets
instead of the rendered routes found **99** problems the route list could never
have covered: 55 colour pairs below 4.5:1 (the `--accent-strong` companion had
existed for a round and almost nothing used it — 40 buttons and chips still
filled with `var(--accent)` at 3.12:1; green and red had no companion at all,
so pay / approve / execute / reject / void all failed), 32
`var(--token, fallback)` declarations whose fallback contradicted its token,
and 12 references to a token nothing ever assigns. A fourth rule, added once
those were green, found the largest single defect of the lot: a bare literal
`color:` renders on whatever the cascade supplies, and `#e04040` — the status
red on error messages, alerts and the danger row-action — is 4.11:1 on
`--surface`, in **106** declarations across 61 files. Twelve more came out
once the rule stopped standing down on a translucent tint, which is the
standard status-pill shape. `--success{,-strong}` and `--danger{,-strong}` now
exist alongside `--accent{,-strong}`, every site is fixed, and
`frontend/src/lib/a11y/tokenPairing.test.ts` fails the suite on a recurrence —
with no suppression mechanism, since a `-strong` companion means a correct
answer always exists. The four routes went in too; the two guards are
complements (the scan can't resolve the cascade, axe can't see a surface no
listed route renders). Rationale in [decisions.md](decisions.md) §28. It also
surfaced the one hole neither can close — white-label theming writes a tenant's
hex straight into `--accent-strong` at runtime — now an inline contrast
advisory on both surfaces that edit it.

Closed in the pass before that, against `improve/round-followup-closeout`: the
three tracked items of that round. **Webhook secret rotation became reachable
from `/admin/webhooks`** (row action → overlap picker → one-time reveal), with
its overlap badge surviving a reload now that `SubscriptionResponse` carries the
expiry. **Vendor statements began accepting a PDF**, routed through the org's own
extraction adapter as an optional `extract_statement` capability rather than a
second parser, with the source document archived. **The cash-flow copilot gained
a proactive shortfall-alert sweep**; its opening-balance-provenance bullet turned
out to be already shipped, and closing it surfaced a real defect underneath — the
provider balance's CURRENCY was dropped, so a USD-reporting org with a EUR
account got a running balance that was silently a two-currency mixture. That is
fixed and the CFO endpoint now shares the same resolution chain.

Closed in the pass before that, against
`feat/settled-amount-and-money-path-followups`: the entire
money-path batch surfaced by the settlement-verification round — **under-settlement
closing the invoice out as fully paid** (migration `0083` puts the settled figure
on the row; the ERP sync holds a short/uncertain settlement and
`POST /api/payments/{id}/settlement/accept` is the release the earlier reverted
attempt lacked), **the two rails settlement verification couldn't reach** (the
optional `PaymentAdapter.fetch_settlement` capability, implemented for Dwolla and
called by both the webhook fallback and the reconciler backstop), **the
minor-unit 2-digit-exponent assumption** (both legs now resolve the real ISO-4217
exponent, moved together), and **`compute_fx_gain_loss` as documented behaviour
over an unwired function** (given a production caller on the settlement audit row,
after removing the dead parameter and the inverted rate convention that made it
unwireable). Only the trust-boundary item below is carried forward.

Closed in the pass before that: the whole **Money path** batch (all eight items — entity
scope on every by-id payment/run route, the `pending_compliance` UI dead end,
run failure visibility + retry, credit-memo netting on the standalone path,
the draft-run Positive Pay guard, bank matching on status + currency, statement
upload idempotency + size cap, and the one-payment-one-bank-transaction unique
index in migration `0081`) and the whole **Trust-boundary** batch (the stale
`tenantSlugUsage` guard, and Playwright cover for the `/profile` Signed-in
devices panel). Nothing from either was carried forward.

Closed in the pass before that: the AI Cash-Flow Copilot Phase 3 core
(draft-run / capture-discounts / enact affordance — shipped in #258, only its
already-deferred sub-bucket remains below), the i18n date-localization slice
(shipped in #258 — verified zero remaining `toLocaleDateString` call sites
outside `utils/time.ts`), all three in-source TODOs (verified removed from
source), and all three diagnosed defects in
[known-issues.md](known-issues.md) (all now fixed/resolved — the "Diagnosed
defects awaiting a fix" section is retired until something new lands there).

---

## (c) Feature work — sized and unstarted

### One adapter family still ships code no caller reaches

- [ ] **`services/financing_adapters` has no production caller.** The
      supply-chain-finance family (`mock` + the `c2fo` skeleton) is built,
      registered and tested, but nothing in `app/` selects a financing provider
      or requests funding. The Protocol violation that used to sit here is
      **fixed** — `C2FOAdapter.quote` / `.request_funding` return an ineligible
      `FinancingQuote` / unfunded `FinancingFundingResult` with
      `reason="provider_not_implemented"` rather than raising
      `NotImplementedError`, pinned by three tests in
      `tests/test_financing_adapters.py`.
      **Why still deferred:** unlike the corridor auction (now wired as an
      advisory read — [decisions.md](decisions.md) §42), financing has **no safe
      read-only half**. A financing quote is only meaningful if it can be
      accepted, and accepting it moves money to a supplier from a third-party
      financier — so wiring it up *is* the product decision about whether the
      platform offers supply-chain financing at all, not a step toward it.
      **Durable fix:** a product call, then the accept path with its own
      approval + audit story.
      **Trigger:** a decision to offer supplier financing.
      Ref: `backend/docs/dynamic-discounting.md`.

- [ ] **`modern_treasury` publishes no fee table, so it is skipped by the
      corridor auction.** `compare_quotes` now has a production caller —
      `POST /api/payments/corridor-quotes`, advisory and read-only — but an
      adapter with no fee schedule correctly reports `no_quote_endpoint` and
      drops out of the ranking, so a tenant on Modern Treasury sees an auction
      its own rail never enters.
      **Durable fix:** its real pricing, transcribed into the adapter's fee
      table. This is data, not code.
      **Trigger:** obtaining Modern Treasury's contracted pricing.
      Ref: `backend/docs/international-payments.md` § Multi-route quote
      optimization.

### E-invoice conformance is checked by our own code, not the official validators

Both generators were corrected this round to meet their standards
([decisions.md](decisions.md) §44, §45), and both are pinned by structural tests.
Neither is validated against the authority that will actually judge it.

- [ ] **BIS Billing 3.0 conformance is a hand-written mandatory-element pass,
      not the official Schematron.** `services/e_invoice/bis3.py::bis3_conformance_errors`
      covers the rules the normalized model can answer, and it gates whether we
      declare the profile at all — so a document that **fails** it provably does
      not conform, which is what makes the conditional declaration sound. It does
      not evaluate the calculation rules (BR-CO-*) or code-list membership, so a
      document that **passes** can still fail the real validator.
      **Durable fix:** vendor the official EN 16931 + PEPPOL Schematron into
      `backend/tests/fixtures/` and assert generated documents validate in CI.
      **Trigger:** the PEPPOL `as4_gateway` slice.

- [ ] **No FatturaPA XSD in the repo, so the generator is validated by
      inspection.** The root-only namespace-qualification fix cites the v1.2
      schema's `elementFormDefault` default and is pinned by a structural test,
      but nothing validates a generated instance against the real XSD.
      **Durable fix:** vendor the v1.2 XSD into `backend/tests/fixtures/` and
      assert the document validates.
      **Trigger:** the SdI clearance slice.

### Backend capabilities with no production caller — CLOSED

All eight entries that stood here were landed in one five-agent round (see
`git log --oneline` for `round7/*`). Each was a built, tested, documented
capability that nothing in `app/`, `scripts/` or `alembic/` reached; three of
them turned out to be masking a live defect rather than merely being unwired:

- `analytics.compute_dpo_trend` — the two inline copies had already **diverged**
  (one excluded `rejected` invoices from the COGS proxy, the other didn't), so
  `/api/analytics/drill/dpo` reported 3.0 days where the chart it explains
  showed 30.0.
- `workflow_engine.is_known_step_type` — `POST /api/workflows/import` is the one
  save path a Pydantic `Literal` doesn't constrain, so a typo'd `"aproval"`
  persisted and was silently skipped at runtime, which the engine reads as *no
  approval step configured*. A spelling mistake could drop a financial control.
- `international_payments.is_international_payment` — unifying the three
  hand-rolled rail sets exposed that a per-org `high_risk_corridor_methods`
  entry of `"SEPA"` (or a blank `[""]`) made `_kyc_required_for` fail **open**,
  disabling the KYC gate for that corridor — or, for a blank entry, for every
  corridor.

The remaining five (`expense_policy.mileage_reimbursement`, Teams outbound
approval actions, sanctions `ScreeningResult.categories`,
`data_residency.check_residency_alignment`, the `avalara`/`taxjar` skeleton
probes) were wiring gaps as described, and are now wired, tested and documented.

Rationale for the non-obvious calls made while closing them:
[decisions.md](decisions.md) §31–§34.

### Consistency debt the round-12 sweep surfaced rather than introduced

Neither is a live defect on the deployed shape; both are the kind of drift that
only becomes a bug once something else changes around it.

- [ ] **~45 `date.today()` sites remain outside the cash-flow stack.**
      `api/analytics.py` (12 sites) and `services/scheduled_reports.py` (3) were
      converted to the new `app/utils/dates.py::utc_today()` this round, and
      `tests/test_utc_today.py` is an AST source-scan drift guard over an
      explicit allowlist of the 9 converged modules. The rest of the app still
      resolves "today" in the SERVER's local timezone: the 1099 forms, Positive
      Pay, the recurring-invoice sweep, the supplier portal, and
      `services/analytics.py:803`'s `today = today or date.today()` fallback
      (unreachable from the converged callers, which now always pass one).
      Latent on a UTC container — the deployed shape — and live on any host that
      is not.
      **Durable fix:** convert each site to `utc_today()` and widen
      `UTC_TODAY_MODULES` in `tests/test_utc_today.py`; the guard is what makes
      this incremental rather than all-or-nothing.
      **Trigger:** the next change to any of those modules, or a decision to run
      the backend on a non-UTC host.

- [ ] **The permissive email regex now has three copies.**
      `^[^\s@]+@[^\s@.]+(?:\.[^\s@.]+)+$` appears in `api/signup.py`,
      `api/partner.py` and (as of this round) `app/schemas/scheduled_report.py`.
      Three copies of a validation rule drift; this one gates who receives a
      tenant's AP data by email.
      **Durable fix:** hoist to `app/utils/` and import in all three.
      **Trigger:** the next change touching signup, partner link codes, or
      scheduled-report recipients.

### Four frontend surfaces still run a transitional path

Round 12 landed the backend legs these were waiting on
(`GET /api/purchase-orders/counts`, `blocked`/`blocked_reason` on
`GET /api/payments/queue`, `GET /api/invoices/assignable-reviewers`, a
`department` leg on requisitions search and a `search` param on expenses). The
frontend was written against them and degrades safely without them, so nothing
is broken — but four surfaces still run the fallback rather than the real path.

- [ ] **`/requisitions` and `/expenses` still filter client-side.** Both API
      clients (`src/lib/api/{requisitions,expenses}.ts`) already send `search`;
      only the page components still filter over the loaded rows, so a term
      matching a row on a later page finds nothing until the user pages to it.
      The regression that blocked this is gone — requisitions search now covers
      `department`, and expenses has a `search` param at all.
      **Durable fix:** pass the term through and delete the client-side filter
      and its honest-but-transitional empty state on both pages.
      **Trigger:** the next slice touching either page.

- [ ] **`InvoiceModal.svelte` still carries its admin-only approver fallback.**
      The picker now has `GET /api/invoices/assignable-reviewers`, so the
      `GET /api/admin/users` fallback is dead weight on a path that 403s for
      every non-admin. Note a CFO gets 403 from the new endpoint too — matching
      `POST /invoices/{id}/assign`, which a CFO also cannot call — so the
      submit-unassigned path stays.
      **Durable fix:** delete the fallback.
      **Trigger:** the next slice touching the invoice modal.

### AI Cash-Flow Copilot — Phase 3 deferred bucket

Phases 1–3 core shipped (read-only cash Q&A, `propose_payment_plan` +
`PlanCard`, and draft-run/capture-discounts enactment — see
[roadmap.md](roadmap.md) § AI Cash-Flow Copilot). Only the
originally-deferred sub-bucket from that same feature remains:

- [ ] Saved plans / plan-vs-actual (`CashPlan` model + migration)
- [ ] Consolidated cross-entity mode

**Trigger:** next feature slice. Nothing blocks it.
Refs: [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) § AI Cash-Flow Copilot,
[cash-flow-copilot.md](cash-flow-copilot.md).

### Tinted badges — the shared primitive exists, half the call sites still hand-roll

The contrast half of this entry is long closed (the 29 badges below 4.5:1, fixed
via tint-paired text tokens — [decisions.md](decisions.md) §30). Round 12 closed
the **ownership** half: `frontend/src/lib/components/ui/Badge.svelte` is now the
single owner of the tinted-badge recipe. A caller names a *tone* and cannot spell
it wrong; `variant` passes the caller's semantic class through as a **selector
hook only** (the e2e suite reads `.badge.approved`), never as colour. Rationale,
including why sizing is fixed rather than a prop and why `neutral` / `erp` stay
non-tinted: [decisions.md](decisions.md) §47.

- [ ] **62 badge-shaped CSS rules still hand-roll the recipe.** The sweep moved
      63 call sites and took the total from **205 rules to 130** (badge-shaped:
      **125 → 62**). The remainder lives in `/expenses`, `/requisitions`,
      `/payments`, `InvoiceModal`, `RequisitionModal`, `ExpenseModal` and
      `/admin/webhooks`.
      **Why deliberately staged rather than finished:** the tokens standardise on
      alpha `.15`, so converting a `.1` or `.12` rule *visibly* strengthens that
      badge. Landing all 125 in one commit would make any visual complaint
      unattributable — which is the same reasoning the original entry used, and
      the reason the first tranche is the size it is.
      **Durable fix:** convert the rest in attributable tranches, checking the
      collapsed distinctions as you go (two were verified in the first tranche —
      recurring's `paused` / `ended` greys, and three punch-out ambers).
      **Trigger:** the next slice touching any of those seven surfaces.

## (a) Blocked on external credentials, accounts, or hardware

None of these are startable from the editor. They are listed so they don't read
as oversights.

- [ ] **SOC 2** — vendor selection (Vanta / Drata / Secureframe / Sprinto),
      policy library, onboarding/offboarding checklist with evidence collection,
      incident-response runbook + on-call rotation, Type I audit, then the Type II
      observation window. **All engineering prereqs are complete**; this is
      process work behind a founder decision and a vendor contract.
      Ref: [soc2-readiness.md](soc2-readiness.md).
- [ ] **Live government e-invoice clearance** — SdI (IT), SAT-PAC (MX), SEFAZ
      (BR), DIAN (CO). The generators and national validation ship as pure
      local-first code; only live authorization remains, and each needs its own
      country registration. Ref: [peppol.md](../backend/docs/peppol.md).
- [ ] **Live sanctions-provider wiring** — the ComplyAdvantage / Dow Jones /
      Refinitiv adapters are fail-closed skeletons awaiting keys. `mock` is the
      local-first default and the screening path itself is shipped and tested.
      Ref: [vendor-risk-screening.md](../backend/docs/vendor-risk-screening.md).
- [ ] **Stripe Billing** — a provisioned Stripe account to verify the live
      `stripe_billing` adapter path end-to-end. All the code that needs it is
      shipped, including the plan-change UI (`/billing`, tested against the
      `mock` adapter) — this is purely the credential to validate the real
      Stripe leg.
      Ref: [billing.md](../backend/docs/billing.md).
- [ ] **Mobile push (FCM + APNs)** — a Firebase project,
      `google-services.json` / `GoogleService-Info.plist`, and an APNs auth key.
      Device-token registration + notification-tap deep-linking are shipped
      (`push_service.dart`); what's blocked is the push-*sending* adapter
      itself, which needs these credentials to build against.
- [ ] **Manual screen-reader device pass** — VoiceOver / NVDA / TalkBack. The
      procedure is documented and repeatable; it needs real AT hardware, so it
      cannot run in CI. The automated axe-core + `meetsGuideline` guards ship.
      Ref: [accessibility-screen-reader-checklist.md](accessibility-screen-reader-checklist.md).
- [ ] **Banking-aggregator (Plaid-style) balance feed** — the bring-your-own and
      provider-`get_balance` paths ship; a real aggregator needs an account.

## (b) Operator steps on merged code

- [ ] **Confirm Teams posts the approval card's action body byte-for-byte.**
      The outbound card stamps each Approve/Reject `HttpPOST` action with the
      HMAC of the exact `body` string it will send, and
      `/api/approvals/teams/interactivity` re-derives it over the raw request
      bytes ([decisions §33](decisions.md)). If Microsoft re-serialised the body
      rather than relaying it verbatim, the digest would not match. The failure
      mode is graceful and already tested — the opaque ack tells the approver to
      sign in to the app, never a 500 or a wrong decision — but only a live
      Teams tenant can confirm the happy path.
      **Durable fix:** post a real card into a Teams channel, click both
      buttons, and confirm the invoice transitions; if the body is re-serialised,
      switch the digest to cover a canonical subset (the action token alone)
      rather than the whole string.
      Ref: [teams-approval.md](../backend/docs/teams-approval.md).

- [ ] **TLS/DNS provisioning runbook for a partner-provisioned child tenant's
      vanity domain.** `POST /api/partner/children/provision` and the
      custom-domain resolver both ship ([decisions §14](decisions.md)); what's
      missing is the written operator procedure for issuing the certificate and
      pointing DNS at the new tenant's hostname.
      **Durable fix:** a runbook under `docs/founder-runbooks/`.
      Ref: [white-label.md](white-label.md) § Custom domains.

- [ ] **OPTIONAL — `DEPENDABOT_LOCKFILE_PAT` is unset, so lockfile sync is
      inert.** `.github/workflows/dependabot-lockfile.yml` regenerates the
      frontend pnpm lockfile and the backend `requirements{,-dev}.lock`, then
      pushes the result onto the Dependabot branch. Its `push` job gates on
      that PAT and skips with a log line when unset — and
      `gh api repos/:owner/:repo/dependabot/secrets` reports `total_count: 0`,
      so the gate has never opened (the pnpm half has never fired either).
      Consequence: a Dependabot manifest bump arrives red, because the stale
      lock fails `backend/tests/test_dependency_lock_sync.py`, and the locks
      get regenerated by hand instead (commands in
      [backend/CLAUDE.md](../backend/CLAUDE.md) § Dependency lock — roughly two
      minutes, weekly at most).

      **This is a convenience, not a blocker, and deliberately not scheduled.**
      Nothing is unsafe while it sits unset: the guard test fails loudly rather
      than shipping undeclared pins, which is the behaviour we want either way.
      It is also worth being honest about the value on offer — Dependabot bumps
      *floors* in `pyproject.toml`, and the floor is not what ships; the lock
      is. The one genuine vulnerability this area has produced so far
      (CVE-2026-69247, `cryptography` 49.0.0) was invisible to Dependabot
      because `cryptography` is transitive via `python-jose[cryptography]` and
      never named in the manifest. Trivy caught it by scanning the built image.

      **Higher-value neighbour:** Dependabot *alerts* are disabled repo-wide
      (`GET /dependabot/alerts` → 403). Enabling them is a settings toggle
      needing no credential, and it is the check that would have flagged the
      `cryptography` CVE against the dependency graph rather than leaving it to
      a container scan. Prefer that over this entry.

      **Durable fix (when wanted):** a fine-grained PAT scoped to this repo
      with `Contents: Write`, stored in the **Dependabot** secret store — NOT
      the Actions store, since Dependabot-authored PRs cannot read Actions
      secrets: `gh secret set DEPENDABOT_LOCKFILE_PAT --app dependabot`. A
      GitHub App token via `actions/create-github-app-token` is the sturdier
      variant — no expiry, not bound to one person's account. The workflow
      header documents the full rationale.
      **Trigger:** when regenerating locks by hand becomes a recurring
      irritation — not on any fixed schedule.
