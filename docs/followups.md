# Open follow-ups

**Open items only.** Completed items are pruned as they land — the code is in
git history and the reasoning belongs in [decisions.md](decisions.md). This file
should shrink as often as it grows.

Every item here is one of:

- **(a)** blocked on an external credential, account, vendor engagement, or
  hardware we don't have;
- **(b)** an operator step on code that is already merged;
- **(c)** a sized-but-unstarted piece of work, or a deferred-with-reason finding
  awaiting a product or architecture call.

This is the destination root `CLAUDE.md` guard rail 6 demands for a deferral —
"deferred / recommended" in a report is a staging area, not an end state. An
item lands here **with its category, the durable fix, and the trigger to do it**,
or it doesn't get deferred.

**What does not belong here:**

| That | Goes here |
|---|---|
| Diagnosed defects with a root cause | [known-issues.md](known-issues.md) |
| Scope + status of work still open | [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) |
| Scope of work already shipped | [roadmap_shipped.md](roadmap_shipped.md) |
| Why something was built the way it was | [decisions.md](decisions.md) |

Each open roadmap section carries an `**Open:**` line naming what's left; the
matching entry here carries the category, durable fix, and trigger. Keep the
pair consistent — if an item leaves this file, its roadmap section either loses
its `**Open:**` line or moves to the archive.

Mirrored as GitHub issue [#321](https://github.com/Absence0760/project-account-payables/issues/321)
for the tracker view. Keep the two reconciled when either moves.

**Last reconciled:** 2026-09-05 (round 21) — a ten-agent round: five fix
agents on the white-label vanity-domain epic plus e-invoice conformance, two
read-only sweeps (backend reachability, frontend/mobile parity), and three more
fix agents on what the parity sweep found. **Five entries closed, one narrowed,
seventeen opened**, 22 → 33.

The count grew on purpose. The two sweeps found substantially more real,
verified work than a ten-agent budget could land; everything with a **live
defect** behind it was fixed in the same round (the ERP retry divergence, the
half-validated UK bank pair, the unpinned SSO authorize helper, the SCIM digest
owner, and the e-invoice generator's BT-106/BT-109 collision), and the verified
remainder is recorded below rather than dropped. A follow-up file that shrinks
while its sweeps keep finding things is measuring the wrong quantity.

Round 21 closed the whole white-label vanity-domain trio the round-20 runbook
surfaced (SPA host resolution, per-tenant outbound links, per-tenant passkeys),
narrowed the BIS Billing 3.0 conformance entry to its official-Schematron half,
and left roadmap Priority 13 with exactly one open piece: the SSO callback URLs,
which stay global on purpose because they are registered at the customer's IdP.

What did **not** move, and why, so it is not re-surveyed next round: the (a) and
(b) sections are unchanged and remain blocked on things this repo cannot
produce — an external credential or account, a scheduled Dependabot run, a live
Teams tenant to observe, or a product/founder decision. The FatturaPA XSD and
the official EN 16931 / PEPPOL Schematron are still deliberately unvendored:
pulling third-party schema files into a **public** repo is a licensing call, and
both triggers are unmet. The eight persona-panel product-fit gaps still await a
keep-or-drop call, which is not Claude's to make.

**Round 19's own narrative has been pruned.** It recorded eight defects that
round found and fixed — an unused dependency setting the project's Node floor,
the budget rollup's 600 queries, the inflated touchless rate, float approval
thresholds, a 4xx that echoed an account number, and three more. All are
shipped; the reasoning lives in [decisions.md](decisions.md) and the code in git
history, which is where this file's own rule says it belongs. Nothing from it
remains open.

## (c) Feature work — sized and unstarted

### One adapter family still ships code no caller reaches

- [ ] **`services/financing_adapters` has no production caller.** The
      supply-chain-finance family (`mock` + the `c2fo` skeleton) is built,
      registered and tested, but nothing in `app/` selects a financing provider
      or requests funding. The Protocol violation that used to sit here is
      **fixed** — `C2FOAdapter.quote` / `.request_funding` return an ineligible
      `FinancingQuote` / unfunded `FinancingFundingResult` with
      `reason="provider_not_implemented"` rather than raising
      `NotImplementedError`, pinned by three tests in
      `tests/test_financing_adapters.py`.
      **Why still deferred:** unlike the corridor auction (now wired as an
      advisory read — [decisions.md](decisions.md) §42), financing has **no safe
      read-only half**. A financing quote is only meaningful if it can be
      accepted, and accepting it moves money to a supplier from a third-party
      financier — so wiring it up *is* the product decision about whether the
      platform offers supply-chain financing at all, not a step toward it.
      **Durable fix:** a product call, then the accept path with its own
      approval + audit story.
      **Trigger:** a decision to offer supplier financing.
      Ref: `backend/docs/dynamic-discounting.md`.

- [ ] **`modern_treasury` publishes no fee table, so it is skipped by the
      corridor auction.** `compare_quotes` now has a production caller —
      `POST /api/payments/corridor-quotes`, advisory and read-only — but an
      adapter with no fee schedule correctly reports `no_quote_endpoint` and
      drops out of the ranking, so a tenant on Modern Treasury sees an auction
      its own rail never enters.
      **Durable fix:** its real pricing, transcribed into the adapter's fee
      table. This is data, not code.
      **Trigger:** obtaining Modern Treasury's contracted pricing.
      Ref: `backend/docs/international-payments.md` § Multi-route quote
      optimization.

### E-invoice conformance is checked by our own code, not the official validators

Both generators were corrected this round to meet their standards
([decisions.md](decisions.md) §44, §45), and both are pinned by structural tests.
Neither is validated against the authority that will actually judge it.

- [ ] **BIS Billing 3.0 conformance is our own re-implementation, not the
      official Schematron.** NARROWED (round 21). The calculation rules
      (BR-CO-*) and code-list membership this entry named are now implemented
      (`services/e_invoice/{en16931_rules,codelists}.py`) and CI-tested, each
      rule with a satisfying and a violating document. Adding them immediately
      earned its keep: the generator mapped `Invoice.subtotal` into **both**
      BT-106 and BT-109, so every invoice carrying a discount or a shipping
      charge went out contradicting itself on BR-CO-13/15/17 with our
      conformance claim on it — fixed at the source in `mapper.py`
      ([decisions.md](decisions.md) §90).
      **What is still open:** (a) rules whose inputs the normalized model has no
      slot for — allowance/charge detail, invoicing periods, VAT point dates
      (tabulated in `en16931_rules`' docstring); (b) membership for UN/ECE Rec 20
      units, UNCL4461 payment means and the CEF EAS scheme list, which get a
      *shape* check only because a partial list would 422 a genuinely conforming
      send; (c) the fact that a pass still means "nothing we can compute
      objects", not conformance. The asymmetry that makes the conditional
      declaration sound is unchanged: a **failure** provably does not conform.
      **Durable fix:** vendor the official EN 16931 + PEPPOL Schematron into
      `backend/tests/fixtures/` and assert generated documents validate in CI.
      Not done this round on purpose — this is a public repo and vendoring
      externally-licensed validation assets is a call to make deliberately.
      **Trigger:** the PEPPOL `as4_gateway` slice.

- [ ] **No FatturaPA XSD in the repo, so the generator is validated by
      inspection.** The root-only namespace-qualification fix cites the v1.2
      schema's `elementFormDefault` default and is pinned by a structural test,
      but nothing validates a generated instance against the real XSD.
      **Durable fix:** vendor the v1.2 XSD into `backend/tests/fixtures/` and
      assert the document validates.
      **Trigger:** the SdI clearance slice.

### Backend capabilities with no production caller — CLOSED

All eight entries that stood here were landed in one five-agent round (see
`git log --oneline` for `round7/*`). Each was a built, tested, documented
capability that nothing in `app/`, `scripts/` or `alembic/` reached; three of
them turned out to be masking a live defect rather than merely being unwired:

- `analytics.compute_dpo_trend` — the two inline copies had already **diverged**
  (one excluded `rejected` invoices from the COGS proxy, the other didn't), so
  `/api/analytics/drill/dpo` reported 3.0 days where the chart it explains
  showed 30.0.
- `workflow_engine.is_known_step_type` — `POST /api/workflows/import` is the one
  save path a Pydantic `Literal` doesn't constrain, so a typo'd `"aproval"`
  persisted and was silently skipped at runtime, which the engine reads as *no
  approval step configured*. A spelling mistake could drop a financial control.
- `international_payments.is_international_payment` — unifying the three
  hand-rolled rail sets exposed that a per-org `high_risk_corridor_methods`
  entry of `"SEPA"` (or a blank `[""]`) made `_kyc_required_for` fail **open**,
  disabling the KYC gate for that corridor — or, for a blank entry, for every
  corridor.

The remaining five (`expense_policy.mileage_reimbursement`, Teams outbound
approval actions, sanctions `ScreeningResult.categories`,
`data_residency.check_residency_alignment`, the `avalara`/`taxjar` skeleton
probes) were wiring gaps as described, and are now wired, tested and documented.

Rationale for the non-obvious calls made while closing them:
[decisions.md](decisions.md) §31–§34.

### Consistency debt the round-12 sweep surfaced rather than introduced

The email-regex entry that stood here is **closed** — hoisted to
`app/utils/emails.py::looks_like_email` with a drift-guard test. Closing it found
a live hole: all three copies ended in `$`, which in Python matches end-of-string
*or just before a trailing newline*, so `"user@example.com\n"` passed every check
and was stored as a login, a child-tenant admin address and a scheduled-report
recipient — a newline reaching an SMTP header is the header-injection primitive.
The shared pattern anchors with `\Z` ([decisions.md](decisions.md) §50).

The `date.today()` sweep is likewise done: **no `.today()` call remains anywhere
under `backend/app/`**, and `tests/test_utc_today.py` now guards 31 modules with a
scanner that catches `date.today()`, `datetime.today()`, `datetime.date.today()`
and naive `datetime.now().date()`. Widening it exposed a hole in the guard itself
— it matched only `ast.Name`, so the attribute-shaped `datetime.date.today()` was
invisible, which is exactly what both Positive Pay modules used; either could have
sat on the "converged" allowlist while still reading local time
([decisions.md](decisions.md) §51). What is left is cosmetic:

The last of it is **closed** too. The six modules that inlined
`datetime.now(UTC).date()` — `api/api_keys`, `api/bank_reconciliation`, the
recurring / contract-renewal / discount-auto-capture sweeps and the mock
financing adapter, plus `api/cash_flow` and the four copilot tools that
predated the helper — now import `utc_today`, and the guard stopped being an
opt-in allowlist: it AST-scans **the whole of `app/`** for a local-timezone
"today", and separately fails on an inlined `datetime.now(UTC).date()` outside
`utils/dates.py`. The allowlist was the right shape while the tree was mixed
and the wrong one once it wasn't — a list cannot see a module nobody added to
it, and a new module is where the next `date.today()` arrives.

### Tinted badges — the primitive owns the recipe; what's left is deliberate keeps

The contrast half of this entry is long closed (the 29 badges below 4.5:1, fixed
via tint-paired text tokens — [decisions.md](decisions.md) §30). Round 12 closed
the **ownership** half: `frontend/src/lib/components/ui/Badge.svelte` is now the
single owner of the tinted-badge recipe. A caller names a *tone* and cannot spell
it wrong; `variant` passes the caller's semantic class through as a **selector
hook only** (the e2e suite reads `.badge.approved`), never as colour. Rationale,
including why sizing is fixed rather than a prop and why `neutral` / `erp` stay
non-tinted: [decisions.md](decisions.md) §47.

**The tranches are done — CLOSED (round 20).** `/discounts` (4),
`/tax` (3), `/vendors` (3) and `/vendor-statements` (1) went to zero, each its
own attributable tranche with the baseline edited down in the same commit. The
two shared-status pages hoisted a `STATUS_TONES` map beside the existing
`STATUS_LABELS` (`types/discounts.ts`, `types/vendor.ts`) so a list page and its
detail modal cannot disagree — the convention rounds 18–19 established.

`/invoices`' `.priors-badge` was the one conversion **refused**, and it moved
above the divider as a deliberate keep. It is not a status: it is an extraction
provenance annotation (`RAG·2·cache·3`, `cursor: help`) rendered *inside the
vendor cell beside the vendor name*, in a fixed-width ellipsised column. The
primitive's metrics would crowd out the name it annotates — the `UsersPanel`
`.you-badge` case verbatim, already an accepted keep for that reason — and it
already takes the `--accent-tint` / `--accent-on-tint` pair, so its colour
cannot drift.

Two things follow, and both are now enforced rather than remembered. The
`--- Still to convert ---` divider is **gone**: every remaining baseline entry
is a keep carrying its own reason, so a new non-zero entry is a keep that must
argue for itself, not a tranche waiting to land. And the audit's own self-check
(`it('detects the recipe it is meant to detect')`) pointed at `/vendors`, which
this round took to zero — it would have begun passing vacuously, so it now
names `ScreeningBadge`, a *permanent* keep that cannot be invalidated by the
next conversion.

### Surfaced by the round-20 parallel sweep — CLOSED except SSO (round 21)

All three entries here said a white-label vanity domain did not really work.
Two are now closed and the third is narrowed to one remaining piece.

**The SPA resolves a vanity host — CLOSED.** The diagnosis was right and the
proposed *cheap half* (validate the first label against the tenant slug, so the
panel refuses the broken shape) was **rejected in favour of the real fix**: it
would have made the panel honest while permanently narrowing the product to
`<slug>.<customer-domain>`, which is not what a customer buys a vanity domain
for. Instead the SPA classifies the hostname against an operator-declared
`PUBLIC_PLATFORM_DOMAINS` (`frontend/src/lib/hostRouting.ts`) and sends **no**
`X-Tenant-Slug` on anything that is not a platform host, which is what finally
reaches the backend `Host` fallback that has existed all along. The API origin
resolves at runtime and collapses to same-origin `/api` on a vanity host,
because a request to the build-time API origin carries the *platform's* `Host`
and defeats the lookup either way. Both layouts now gate on `hasTenantContext()`
instead of the slug — without that they rendered the marketing landing page to a
customer on their own domain, so the rest would have been invisible.
Unset config replays the old rule byte-for-byte, so no existing build changes on
upgrade ([decisions.md](decisions.md) §86).

**Per-tenant outbound links — CLOSED.** `settings.brand.tenant_url_template`
overrides the global, resolved by one `app/utils/tenant_urls.py` that all
**ten** call sites read — not the six this entry claimed; `services/supplier_chat`
and `services/card_issuance` both did their own substitution and did not look
like template call sites from the outside. An unresolvable base is now a real
answer: callers omit the link rather than fabricate a `localhost` URL into a
customer's inbox ([decisions.md](decisions.md) §91).

**Per-tenant passkeys — CLOSED.** RP ID and origins resolve from the tenant's
own registered custom domains, from the org that owns *the account*, never from
a `Host`-driven lookup — so a forged host, an unknown host and another tenant's
vanity domain all fail closed to the platform RP. The migration story this entry
said "needs designing, not just a config field" was designed and shipped:
`webauthn_credentials.rp_id` (migration 0091), `usable_here` on the list
endpoint, and a named cross-host message so a credential registered elsewhere
reports itself instead of failing opaquely ([decisions.md](decisions.md) §87).

- [ ] **(c) SSO callback URLs still pin a vanity-domain tenant to the platform
      host.** `services/sso.py` builds the OIDC `redirect_uri` and the SAML
      bridge URL from the global `FEOH_TENANT_URL_TEMPLATE`, and was
      deliberately left there when the other eight call sites moved: both are
      values **registered at the customer's IdP**, so a silent per-org re-point
      breaks every SSO login until the operator re-registers them. Both
      exemptions are asserted in the resolver's drift guard, so they read as
      decisions rather than misses ([decisions.md](decisions.md) §91).
      Consequence today: a vanity-host tenant with SSO enabled either keeps
      logging in via the platform hostname, or turns SSO off. The SPA also
      hides the SSO/SAML buttons on a vanity host, because
      `GET /api/auth/sso/authorize` takes the tenant as a required `?slug=`
      query param that a vanity host has no way to supply — which is why
      `routes/login/+page.svelte` is the one remaining entry on the
      `BUILD_TIME_API_URL_BASELINE` ratchet in `tenantSlugUsage.test.ts`.
      **Durable fix:** accept a `Host`-resolved tenant when `slug` is absent on
      the SSO/SAML entry points, plus a per-org callback override, plus the IdP
      re-registration step in
      [custom-domain-provisioning.md](founder-runbooks/custom-domain-provisioning.md).
      **Trigger:** the first customer cutting over to a vanity host with SSO
      enabled.

- [ ] **(b) True end-to-end e2e for the vanity host needs two env lines.** The
      unit layer covers the classification rules exhaustively and the e2e spec
      locks the *platform*-host half (the catastrophic regression path — a
      platform subdomain must keep sending its slug and keep calling the
      build-time origin). The vanity half is unit-only because
      `PUBLIC_PLATFORM_DOMAINS` reaches neither run mode: locally the suite
      boots `pnpm dev` (which loads `.env.development`), and CI serves a
      production-mode `vite build` that does not. Unset means *no host is a
      vanity host*, so the same navigation would assert opposite things in the
      two environments — which is why the spec does not fake it.
      **Durable fix:** add `PUBLIC_PLATFORM_DOMAINS` beside `PUBLIC_API_URL` in
      `playwright.config.ts` `webServer.env` **and** in the CI build step, then
      add a second hostname that serves both the SPA and `/api` (neither `vite
      dev` nor `vite preview` proxies `/api`, so a same-origin call 404s at the
      static server today).
      **Trigger:** the same first vanity-domain onboarding.

### Surfaced by the round-19 parallel sweep (2026-09-05)

**Indexed — CLOSED (round 20).** Migration `0090_invoice_budget_dim_idx`,
gated on the `invoices` table existing (the shape 0044 and 0088 use) so it
no-ops on the control plane and fans out via `migrate_all_tenants.py`; the model
declares `index=True` so `create_all`-provisioned tenants match, and the names
follow SQLAlchemy's default so the two provisioning paths cannot diverge.

Measured before landing, as this entry demanded. Median of 7 warm runs against
the SQL `budget_service._actual_invoice_legs` actually emits, on a scratch
tenant with **independently randomised** dimension and status — a first
generator keyed both off `i % N`, correlating them into a misleading zero-row
case, and was discarded. `department` is the control and must not move:

| Invoices | `cost_center` | `gl_account` | `department` (control) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 40 000 | 7.7 ms → **1.8 ms** | 6.5 ms → **1.5 ms** | 2.7 ms → 2.7 ms |
| 200 000 | 15.9 ms → **7.4 ms** | 14.9 ms → **6.7 ms** | 9.6 ms → 9.6 ms |

Seq Scan → Bitmap Index Scan; buffers 1003 → 578 at 40k, which is the durable
number — seq-scan cost grows with the *table*, index-scan cost with the
*matching subset*.

**What it does not fix, recorded so nobody re-measures it hoping:** the
whole-tenant rollup over ~half the distinct cost centers is 10.3 ms → 9.1 ms —
inside noise, and slightly *more* buffers. At that selectivity a seq scan is the
right plan. This is a fix for the *selective* path — `GET /budgets/{id}/spend`
and `GET /budgets/check`, the latter running before every requisition submit.

The guard test walks every `BudgetDimension` through `_DIMENSION_MATCH_COLUMN`
to an indexed column, so a fifth dimension added on an unindexed one fails
rather than silently reintroducing the asymmetry.

**The operator can now assert the cutover — CLOSED (round 20).**
`backend/scripts/backfill_import_provenance.py` is exactly the tool this entry
specified and nothing more: `--cutover` is required, has no default, and is the
only thing that sets the boundary. Nothing is inferred from the data — that was
the whole point ([decisions.md](decisions.md) §81).

Safety properties, each with a test: dry run is the **default** (`--apply` is
the only mutating switch), one **named** tenant (there is no all-tenants mode),
the bound is strictly `created_at < cutover`, a **future** cutover is refused (a
migration that has not run produced no history, and that date would stamp live
invoices), and candidates come through `csv_import.native_invoice_clause()`
rather than a restated predicate, so an already-marked row is excluded in SQL
and a re-run can neither double-stamp nor overwrite a real `csv_import` marker.
A stamping run appends one PII-free `invoice.import_provenance_backfilled` audit
row; a dry run writes nothing. The marker records that it was *asserted* rather
than observed (`source=operator_backfill`, `asserted=true`), so a later reader
can tell a declared provenance from a recorded one.

**The smoke run changed the design, and it is worth knowing why.** A date bound
alone over-captures: on the dev tenant a cutover of today proposed 90 rows, 58
of them in statuses `csv_import` provably cannot land. Stamping those would have
*deleted genuinely native invoices from the metric* — the exact failure the
no-backfill rule existed to prevent, arriving through the front door. So the
tool restricts to importable statuses (imported from `csv_import`,
drift-guarded) and reports the rest as skipped. That is not the rejected
identify-by-status inference: it only ever refuses to mark, and a refusal leaves
the row reading exactly as it does today.

The caveat is in `backend/docs/analytics.md` in full: a wrong date mis-stamps in
either direction, neither direction is detectable from the data, and the tool
does not reverse it.

### Surfaced by the round-18 parallel sweep (2026-09-05)

Four items the round-18 agents traced to a file and line but correctly did not
fold into their own slice. None is a defect that can bite today.

- [ ] **(c) No live payment adapter consumes the wire ABA yet.**
      `resolve_routing_number` picks the right routing number per rail, but every
      shipped adapter identifies the payee by a processor **counterparty token**
      and transmits no raw bank coordinates — so today the resolver's only live
      consumers are the `mock` adapter and Positive Pay's ACH file (which reads
      the ACH number and is correct unchanged). The wire number is stored,
      staged under dual control, and surfaced; it is not yet transmitted.
      **Why it is not a defect:** the field had to exist before a counterparty
      provisioning path could send it, and the resolver is what makes the rail
      distinction unambiguous when one arrives.
      **Durable fix:** counterparty provisioning at the processor, which this
      codebase does not model at all.
      **Trigger:** wiring a payment adapter that hands a bank raw coordinates.
      See [decisions.md](decisions.md) §74.

### Surfaced by the persona-panel round-2 parallel fix batch (issue #328)

- **`pnpm i` dropping the frontend's security-pin overrides — SUPERSEDED.**
  This entry described pnpm 11 no longer reading `pnpm.overrides` from
  `frontend/package.json` (where `cookie@<0.7.0` and `undici@<7.28.0` are
  pinned), so a plain `pnpm i` regenerated the lockfile with the CVE pins
  silently gone. Its proposed fix was a `frontend/pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
  **A different fix landed** in #353: both `package.json` files now pin
  `packageManager: pnpm@10.12.4` and every `pnpm/action-setup` site reads it
  instead of passing `version:`, so one pnpm — a 10.x that does read that
  location — writes the lockfile everywhere. The pin is the thing to preserve;
  moving the overrides is only needed if the project later moves to pnpm 11+.
  What remains open is the *verification*, tracked below as
  § Surfaced while clearing the open-PR backlog → "Confirm the `packageManager`
  pin stopped Dependabot dropping the pnpm overrides", which is where the recipe
  and the recurrence instructions live. Kept as a pointer rather than deleted:
  the diagnosis (which pnpm versions read which location) is the expensive half.

### Surfaced by the issue #328 checklist reconciliation (2026-08-27)

Going through all 56 persona-panel findings + 8 acknowledged gaps against `main`
after PRs #329, #330 and #341 landed left **13 findings genuinely open** plus
**8 product-fit gaps awaiting a keep-or-drop call**. They are parked here so
issue #328 can close — the checklist itself is not a destination (guard rail 6).
Every one is category **(c)**: a sized-but-unstarted piece of work, or a
deferred-with-reason finding awaiting a product/architecture call.

**Progress — PR #343** (`feat/portal-invoice-search-filter`):

| #328 finding | Status in #343 |
|---|---|
| Portal invoice list — no status/number filter | **done** — repeatable `status=` + `search=`, vendor-facing phase chips |
| Portal payment list — no status/number filter | **done** — same, via shared `PortalListFilters.svelte` |
| Vendor can't see why an invoice was rejected | **done** — `rejection_reason` on the portal API + rendered under the status pill |
| No resubmit path for a rejected portal invoice | **done** — `POST /portal/invoices/{id}/resubmit` + "Revise & resubmit" row control |
| URL filter/search persistence partial on `/invoices` `/payments` `/vendors` | **done** — `search` + status chip + (payments) tab now in the query string |
| No onboarding empty-state / CTA for a zero-data tenant | **done** — shared `ui/EmptyState.svelte`, adopted on the dashboard, `/invoices`, and `/portal/invoices` |
| No UI to create a vendor / invite one to the supplier portal | **done** — `+ New Vendor` header action (`CreateVendorModal`) + `Invite` row action (`InviteVendorPortalUserModal` → `SecretReveal`) |
| `/payments/queue` has no pagination | **done** — `?page=` on `GET /queue`, a `GET /queue/ids` select-all resolver, Load-More + whole-set select-all on the Queue tab |

**Frontend gaps — built on the backend, unreachable in the product:**

- [x] **UI to create a vendor + invite one to the supplier portal — DONE
      (PR #343).** `+ New Vendor` header action (`vendor.manage`-gated) opens
      `CreateVendorModal` (`POST /api/vendors`; no bank field — the backend
      dual-control-stages that on create); an `Invite` row action
      (`auth.isManager`) opens `InviteVendorPortalUserModal`
      (`POST /api/vendors/{id}/portal-users`) whose one-time temp password is
      shown via the shared `SecretReveal`. Guard:
      `tests-e2e/vendors/create-invite.spec.ts`.

- [x] **No onboarding empty-state / CTA for a zero-data tenant — DONE
      (PR #343).** `ui/EmptyState.svelte` (icon + heading + description +
      optional button/link action, i18n-agnostic) is adopted on the dashboard
      (zero invoices → `/invoices`), `/invoices` (zero rows + no filter → the
      upload action, role-gated), `/portal/invoices` (vendor submitted nothing
      → the submit action), and `/vendors` (zero vendors + no filter → the
      `+ New Vendor` action, `vendor.manage`-gated — gated on a first-fetch
      `loaded` flag so it doesn't flash during load, and on `!loadErrored`).
      Each page keeps its `DataTable` + loading/errored/filtered-empty copy
      for every other state. Guards:
      `tests-e2e/reactivity/empty-state.spec.ts` (`/invoices` + `/vendors`).

- [x] **[Low] Organization/Settings first-time-admin prioritization — DONE
      (PR #343).** A "Getting started" wayfinding strip at the top of
      `/organization` links a new admin to the five sections they configure
      first (Company Profile, Invoice Defaults, Users & Roles, approval
      thresholds, Branding). Sections are neither reordered nor hidden — it's a
      shortcut strip with anchor `id=`s. Guard:
      `tests-e2e/organization/getting-started.spec.ts`.

- [ ] **[Low] The marketing pricing page (`Pricing.svelte`) is USD-only.**
      Hardcoded `$` figures; no currency awareness.
      **Durable fix:** a product call on whether to localise pricing at all, then
      per-locale figures if yes.
      **Trigger:** an international pricing decision.

**Supplier portal — the loop-closing steps are missing:**

- [x] **A vendor can see why an invoice is *stuck* — DONE (PR #343).** The
      *rejected* half (`rejection_reason`) shipped earlier in the PR;
      `GET /portal/invoices[/{id}]` now also carries `waiting_on` — a PII-free
      bucket (`review` / `processing` / `erp`) plus `waiting_on_days`, set
      **only** while the invoice is in a processing phase, NULL for
      `new`/`approved`/`paid`/`rejected`/`done`. Never an internal status
      string or a user name. Rendered as a localized line under the status
      pill ("Awaiting your customer's review · 5 days"). Guard:
      `tests/test_portal_waiting_on.py`. (A finer step-level detail off the
      workflow instance was scoped down to the phase-bucket + age — enough to
      add information beyond the chip without touching workflow internals.)

**Volume surfaces:**

- [x] **`GET /api/payments/queue` pagination — DONE (PR #343).** `?page=` /
      `?page_size=` on `GET /queue` (order `due_date ASC NULLS LAST, id ASC` —
      the `id` tie-breaker the invoice list has), plus a `GET /queue/ids`
      resolver for the whole selectable set (capped, currency-bucketed). The
      Queue tab renders Load-More; "select all N matching" resolves via
      `/queue/ids` (not the loaded rows) and the pay-bar count / per-currency
      subtotals / mixed-currency guard derive from the whole-set rollup.
      Guards: `tests/test_payment_queue_pagination.py`,
      `tests-e2e/payments/queue-pagination.spec.ts`.

- [x] **URL filter/search persistence on `/invoices`, `/payments`, `/vendors`
      — DONE (PR #343).** Each page now initialises `search` + the status chip
      from the query string and folds them into its `syncUrl()` writer
      (untracked, called from the filter effect + the debounce timer);
      `/payments` also persists the active tab. Guard:
      `tests-e2e/reactivity/filter-url-persistence.spec.ts`; the debounce it
      sits next to stays covered by `search-debounce-race.spec.ts`.

- [ ] **The invoice tax model has no rate category or reverse-charge flag, and
      UK domestic (same-country) VAT reverse charge is structurally
      impossible.** `Invoice`/`InvoiceLineItem` carry one flat
      `tax_amount`/`tax_rate`; `international_tax/vat.py` hardcodes domestic
      reverse charge to `False` and models GB as non-EU, so the UK CIS domestic
      reverse charge can never be expressed, and the `/api/international-tax`
      calculator is never wired to a real invoice.
      **Durable fix:** a tax-treatment design session — per-line rate category +
      a reverse-charge flag on the line, the calculator wired into the invoice
      lifecycle, and a real frontend for it. Explicitly scoped out of the
      parallel bug-fix rounds as architecture, not a fix.
      **Trigger:** a decision to support UK/EU VAT properly (a prerequisite for
      the UK-business go-to-market).

- [x] **GBP→GB domestic payment rails — DONE (PR #343).** `bacs`,
      `faster_payments`, `chaps` added to the `PaymentMethod` enum, classified
      on both `payment_methods.py` axes (IRS-reportable + `DOMESTIC`), with fee
      anchors as `Decimal`. `pick_corridor` gets a GBP/GB branch:
      `not requires_fx and target_currency == "GBP" and country in (None, "GB")`
      → Faster Payments (no SWIFT, no FX lock, no IBAN — UK domestic uses sort
      code + account number even though `is_sepa_country("GB")` is true).
      Cross-currency into GBP still routes `international_wire`. No migration
      (`Payment.method` is a `String`); only the `mock` adapter gained the
      rails. Guards: `tests/test_payment_corridor_uk_domestic.py`, extended
      `test_payment_methods.py`.
      **Still open (separate finding, above):** the per-line VAT tax model —
      that's the architecture item, unrelated to the payment rail.

**Investigated, deliberately not changed (recorded so it isn't re-litigated):**

- `approve_payment_run` stays on `require_roles(ROLE_CFO)` rather than
  `require_permission(PERM_PAYMENT_RUN_APPROVE)`. Migrating it was tried and
  reverted during #330 — it let non-CFO admin/ap_manager bypass the
  CFO-approval-threshold control (a real regression caught by CI). The inline
  comment in `backend/app/api/payments.py` is the durable record.

### Persona-panel acknowledged gaps — ⚠️ PRODUCT REVIEW NEEDED (issue #328)

Eight capabilities the personas confirmed absent and classified as *product-fit
gaps* (the app never claimed them), not defects. **None is a bug — each is a
deliberate scope decision waiting to be made.** For each: **keep** it (→ add to
`docs/roadmap.md`, size it) or **drop** it (→ record as a documented non-goal in
`docs/competitive-analysis.md` / the relevant doc so it isn't re-filed every
persona round). The `[ ]` is checked when the keep/drop call is recorded, not
when the feature ships.

A suggested lean is given per gap — **`lean: keep`** / **`lean: drop`** /
**`lean: ?`** (genuine toss-up) — to make the review a yes/no rather than an
open discussion. Owner: a product/founder call; nothing here is Claude's to
decide.

- [ ] **No US sales/use-tax self-assessment** — no self-assessed use tax on
      out-of-state purchases, no nexus tracking, no resale/exemption
      certificates. `Invoice.tax_rate` only records what the vendor charged. US
      AP table stakes above a certain company size. **`lean: keep`** (real US
      mid-market requirement; large, own epic).
- [ ] **No saved views / per-list default view, and no keyboard shortcuts or
      command palette** anywhere in the app. **`lean: ?`** (power-user polish;
      high effort, diffuse payoff — defer unless a design partner asks).
### Surfaced while clearing the open-PR backlog (2026-09-02)

- [ ] **(b) The Dependabot pip-grouping fix is applied but UNVERIFIED.**
      `patterns: ["*"]` was added alongside `update-types` on the
      `backend-minor-patch` group on 2026-09-05, matching the two groups in that
      file that demonstrably do group (`actions`, `fake-erp`). A Dependabot
      config change cannot be verified without waiting for its next scheduled
      run, so this is a candidate, not a fix.
      **Note the hypothesis is already partly contradicted:** the `npm` group has
      the identical no-`patterns` shape and groups anyway, so `patterns` may not
      be the operative difference.
      **Confirmed if** next Monday's pip bumps arrive on one
      `dependabot/pip/backend/backend-minor-patch-…` branch; **refuted if** they
      again arrive as separate `dependabot/pip/backend/<dep>-gte-…` branches.
      **If confirmed:** apply the same one-liner to `terraform-minor-patch`,
      which carries the same untested shape and was deliberately left alone.
      **Trigger:** next Monday's Dependabot run.

- [ ] **Confirm the `packageManager` pin stopped Dependabot dropping the pnpm
      overrides.** Two npm PRs in one day (#344, #351) arrived with the whole
      `overrides:` block deleted from `frontend/pnpm-lock.yaml` while
      `package.json` still declared `pnpm.overrides` for `cookie@<0.7.0` and
      `undici@<7.28.0`, red on every job that installs. Root cause was that
      nothing declared which pnpm writes that lockfile, so four wrote it (CI on
      9, `audit.yml` on 10, contributors on whatever, Dependabot on its own
      default). Both package.json files now pin `pnpm@10.12.4` and every
      `pnpm/action-setup` site reads it instead of passing `version:`.
      The divergence is fixed and verified. Whether it also fixes Dependabot is
      a **hypothesis** — it cannot be tested without waiting for the next npm
      PR.
      **If it recurs:** regenerate by hand (`pnpm install --lockfile-only`, then
      confirm the block survived), exactly as § (b) describes for the pip locks.
      Do NOT reach for `--no-frozen-lockfile`: those are conditional floor
      guards against a future transitive downgrade, inert today
      (`cookie@0.7.2`, `undici@8.10.0` both already clear them), which is
      precisely what makes losing one easy to miss.
      **Trigger:** the next Dependabot npm PR. Recipe in
      [frontend/CLAUDE.md](../frontend/CLAUDE.md) § The lockfile.

### Surfaced by the round-21 parallel sweeps (2026-09-05)

Two read-only sweeps ran alongside the round-21 fix agents: a backend
reachability pass (the same shape as the round-7 "no production caller" sweep)
and a frontend/mobile parity pass (backend capabilities with no UI). Between
them they found more than the ten-agent budget could land. **Everything with a
live defect behind it was fixed in round 21** — the ERP retry divergence
([decisions.md](decisions.md) §88), the half-validated UK bank pair (§89), the
unpinned SSO authorize helper, and the SCIM digest's missing owner. What is
below is the verified remainder: real, reproducible, and none of it a defect
that can bite today.

**Backend capabilities with no production caller:**

- [ ] **(c) `approval_chain.get_chain_progress` has no caller, and eight sites
      read its JSONB path by hand.** `services/approval_chain.py` (×2),
      `services/review.py` (×4, two of them re-deriving the same expression on
      adjacent lines) and `services/approval_escalation.py` (×2) each reach into
      `state_data["approval_levels"]` themselves, in **two spellings** —
      `.get("approval_levels", {})` and `.get("approval_levels") or {}` — which
      differ when the key is present but `null`. No behavioural bug found today;
      the risk is the next schema move having to find eight sites.
      **Durable fix:** route all eight through the existing helper and add the
      drift guard this repo already uses elsewhere (a source scan asserting no
      module outside `approval_chain.py` string-matches `"approval_levels"`),
      exactly as `payment_methods` and `utc_today` are guarded.
      **Trigger:** the next change to the approval-chain state shape.

- [ ] **(c) `workflow_step_types.is_canonical_step_type` is unused and
      untested.** `workflow_builder` asks the inverse question via
      `BUILDER_STEP_TYPES` and handles aliases correctly, so this is a
      convenience wrapper nothing needs. **Durable fix:** delete it, or give it
      a caller and coverage — an untested helper in the module that gates a
      financial control ([decisions.md](decisions.md) §32) should not be a third
      spelling of the question. **Trigger:** the next workflow-step-type change.

- [ ] **(c) `scheduled_reports.compute_next_run`'s docstring is now false.** It
      says "used when seeding a brand-new schedule", but `api/scheduled_reports`
      deliberately seeds `next_run_at = body.next_run_at or now()` so an
      operator can watch the first run happen. A doc fix, not a wiring fix —
      recorded so the next sweep does not re-derive it as a gap.
      **Trigger:** any edit to the scheduled-report runner.

**Backend capabilities the product cannot reach (no UI):**

- [ ] **(c) The per-tenant email-intake address has no UI, and the docs claim it
      does.** `GET /api/organization/email-intake` + `POST .../rotate-token`
      have no frontend caller, while
      [email-intake.md](../backend/docs/email-intake.md) asserts "the tenant's
      admin sees the address in Organization Settings and tells their vendors."
      Two consequences: the whole inbound-email ingestion channel is
      undiscoverable, and — the sharper one — **a leaked intake token cannot be
      rotated from the product**, though the same doc calls that token a bearer
      secret that lets anyone drop PDFs into the tenant's AP queue.
      **Durable fix:** one `/organization` panel beside Custom Domains; the
      rotate control is the armed two-click + `ui/SecretReveal.svelte` pattern
      `/admin/webhooks` already uses for `rotate-secret`. Fix the doc in the
      same change.
      **Trigger:** next `/organization` slice — this is the highest-value item
      in this list.

- [ ] **(c) `POST /api/entities` and `PATCH /api/entities/{id}` have no UI, so
      multi-entity is effectively unstartable.** The sidebar switcher reads
      `GET /api/entities` and hides itself below two entities, so a tenant can
      only ever have the one entity created at provisioning. Multi-entity is
      documented as complete (Phases 1–4) and scored a competitive "Have".
      **Durable fix:** an `/admin/entities` page (list + create modal + edit +
      set-default) matching the existing `/admin/*` shape.
      **Trigger:** the first tenant with a subsidiary. Note
      `POST /api/invoices/{id}/route-intercompany` is also caller-less and stays
      moot until this lands.

- [ ] **(c) The whole `/api/adaptive` router (9 endpoints) and `/api/inspections`
      (4) have no route.** Adaptive covers approval-pattern learning, anomalies,
      advisory suggestions + dismiss, smart-routing recommend/apply, threshold
      recommend/apply and the feedback loop — two of them *write* surfaces with
      full RBAC and audit stories, and one of its own guards is described as
      protecting "against applying a stale **UI** value". Inspections is sharper
      than it looks: the invoice warnings panel **renders** `inspection_result`,
      `inspection_accepted_quantity` and `quality_hold`, so the UI shows the
      consequences of an inspection while offering no way to enter one (the
      4-way-match e2e spec creates them via `page.request.post`, bypassing the
      app). Both are scored competitive "Have"s.
      **Durable fix:** an `/adaptive` page shaped like `/experiments`; an
      Inspections tab or modal on `/goods-receipts` plus a sync action.
      **Trigger:** a decision to market either capability.

- [ ] **(c) Smaller caller-less surfaces, verified.** `GET /api/audit/verify-signatures`
      + the per-invoice variant (an auditor cannot run the approval-signature
      HMAC check from the console built for auditors); the card-rebate
      lifecycle (`GET /api/cards/rebates`, `confirm`, `mark-paid`, `cancel`,
      `generate` — the Cards tab renders a "pending confirmation" hint for a
      status it gives no way to advance, and the recorded reason "API-only,
      mirroring `/bank-reconciliation`" is stale now that page shipped);
      `POST /api/payments/corridor-quotes`; `POST /api/exceptions/{id}/agent-resolve`
      (the agent dashboard reports on activity it cannot trigger);
      `POST /api/discounts/bulk-negotiate`; the two `/api/enrichment` read
      endpoints; and `GET /api/health/sweeps`.
      **Durable fix:** each is a small addition to a page that already exists.
      **Trigger:** take them opportunistically when next in the relevant page.

- [ ] **(c) Mobile: the CFO cannot approve a payment run.** The Pay tab is
      visible to a CFO and a gated run renders "This run needs CFO approval
      before it can be executed", but `endpoints.dart` calls only `execute` and
      `cancel` — `/approve` is absent. The one person who can unblock the run is
      the person reading the message. **Durable fix:** one menu item in the
      existing `_runMenuAction` popup, gated on `AuthStore` CFO.
      **Trigger:** next mobile slice. (Also: Contracts ships on mobile —
      `contracts_screen.dart` + detail + localized — but appears in neither the
      screens→API table nor the feature-status list in `mobile/CLAUDE.md`.
      Shipped and undocumented, the inverse of the usual problem.)

**Frontend consistency:**

- [ ] **(c) `INTAKE_STATUS_LABELS` / `REQUISITION_STATUS_LABELS` are hardcoded
      English.** In `src/lib/types/*.ts` and not routed through i18n, so a
      German user now sees a translated Reopen confirm ("Zurück auf „Entwurf“")
      next to an untranslated `DRAFT` badge. Pre-existing; surfaced by the
      round-21 reopen work rather than caused by it.
      **Durable fix:** move both maps behind `MessageKey`s like the other status
      label sets. **Trigger:** the next i18n or procurement slice.

- [ ] **(c) `/organization` has no client-side admin gate on any panel.** A
      non-admin who navigates directly gets a fully editable form whose every
      Save 403s. Pre-existing and consistent across ~10 panels, which is why the
      round-21 branding work did not add one for a single field.
      **Durable fix:** a page-level `auth.isAdmin` read-only mode for the whole
      route. **Trigger:** next `/organization` slice.

**Backend ergonomics the e-invoice UI work surfaced:**

- [ ] **(c) No read path for an invoice's PEPPOL transmission state.**
      `PeppolTransmission` is referenced only for delete-cascade; nothing exposes
      whether an invoice has already been transmitted. The send response carries
      `already_sent`, so the UI can report the outcome truthfully but cannot show
      the state on open, and deliberately makes no "not yet sent" claim.
      **Durable fix:** `GET /api/invoices/{id}/peppol-transmissions`, or a field
      on the invoice detail. **Trigger:** the `as4_gateway` slice.

- [ ] **(c) The e-invoice 422 drops the human half of its own error.**
      `FieldError` carries a PII-free `message` ("FatturaPA requires a Partita
      IVA…"), but `EInvoiceValidationError.__str__` emits only `field: code`, so
      every client must maintain its own code→prose map — the frontend now has
      one. **Durable fix:** return the structured errors and delete the client
      map. **Trigger:** the next e-invoicing slice.

## (a) Blocked on external credentials, accounts, or hardware

None of these are startable from the editor. They are listed so they don't read
as oversights.

- [ ] **SOC 2** — vendor selection (Vanta / Drata / Secureframe / Sprinto),
      policy library, onboarding/offboarding checklist with evidence collection,
      incident-response runbook + on-call rotation, Type I audit, then the Type II
      observation window. **All engineering prereqs are complete**; this is
      process work behind a founder decision and a vendor contract.
      Ref: [soc2-readiness.md](soc2-readiness.md).
- [ ] **Live government e-invoice clearance** — SdI (IT), SAT-PAC (MX), SEFAZ
      (BR), DIAN (CO). The generators and national validation ship as pure
      local-first code; only live authorization remains, and each needs its own
      country registration. Ref: [peppol.md](../backend/docs/peppol.md).
- [ ] **Live sanctions-provider wiring** — the ComplyAdvantage / Dow Jones /
      Refinitiv adapters are fail-closed skeletons awaiting keys. `mock` is the
      local-first default and the screening path itself is shipped and tested.
      Ref: [vendor-risk-screening.md](../backend/docs/vendor-risk-screening.md).
- [ ] **Stripe Billing** — a provisioned Stripe account to verify the live
      `stripe_billing` adapter path end-to-end. All the code that needs it is
      shipped, including the plan-change UI (`/billing`, tested against the
      `mock` adapter) — this is purely the credential to validate the real
      Stripe leg.
      Ref: [billing.md](../backend/docs/billing.md).
- [ ] **Mobile push (FCM + APNs)** — a Firebase project,
      `google-services.json` / `GoogleService-Info.plist`, and an APNs auth key.
      Device-token registration + notification-tap deep-linking are shipped
      (`push_service.dart`); what's blocked is the push-*sending* adapter
      itself, which needs these credentials to build against.
- [ ] **Manual screen-reader device pass** — VoiceOver / NVDA / TalkBack. The
      procedure is documented and repeatable; it needs real AT hardware, so it
      cannot run in CI. The automated axe-core + `meetsGuideline` guards ship.
      Ref: [accessibility-screen-reader-checklist.md](accessibility-screen-reader-checklist.md).
- [ ] **Banking-aggregator (Plaid-style) balance feed** — the bring-your-own and
      provider-`get_balance` paths ship; a real aggregator needs an account.

---

## (b) Operator steps on merged code

- [ ] **Confirm Teams posts the approval card's action body byte-for-byte.**
      The outbound card stamps each Approve/Reject `HttpPOST` action with the
      HMAC of the exact `body` string it will send, and
      `/api/approvals/teams/interactivity` re-derives it over the raw request
      bytes ([decisions §33](decisions.md)). If Microsoft re-serialised the body
      rather than relaying it verbatim, the digest would not match. The failure
      mode is graceful and already tested — the opaque ack tells the approver to
      sign in to the app, never a 500 or a wrong decision — but only a live
      Teams tenant can confirm the happy path.
      **Durable fix:** post a real card into a Teams channel, click both
      buttons, and confirm the invoice transitions; if the body is re-serialised,
      switch the digest to cover a canonical subset (the action token alone)
      rather than the whole string.
      Ref: [teams-approval.md](../backend/docs/teams-approval.md).

**Written — CLOSED (round 20).**
[`docs/founder-runbooks/custom-domain-provisioning.md`](founder-runbooks/custom-domain-provisioning.md)
covers both deployment shapes, because the certificate story differs between
them: Caddy + Let's Encrypt HTTP-01 on the single VM (per-host site block,
automatic renewal, no separate validation record) and ACM in `us-east-1` behind
CloudFront alternate domain names (a permanent `_token` CNAME the customer owns;
certs are immutable, so onboarding re-issues). Plus the DNS records, the CORS
env change, end-to-end verification through the public branding endpoint,
rollback, and the failure modes this code path actually has.

The whole AWS branch and every quota figure are marked confirm-on-first-run:
`infra/` is KMS + S3 only, so no distribution or certificate exists yet, and no
ARN or resource name was invented.

**Restored, without the credential that made it inert — CLOSED (round 20).**
`.github/workflows/dependabot-lockfile.yml` is back. The reason it was removed
in #325 is designed out rather than re-gated: it no longer needs a
`DEPENDABOT_LOCKFILE_PAT`, so there is no missing-secret gate left to
skip-and-succeed. It runs on `pull_request_target` (base-branch context, so
`GITHUB_TOKEN` can carry `contents: write`), filtered to the four manifests and
gated on `github.actor == 'dependabot[bot]'` plus a same-repo head — strictly
less privileged than `dependabot-auto-merge.yml`, which already merges these
PRs on the same trigger.

Three jobs, and only one holds `contents: write`. The two resolver jobs check
out PR head **by immutable SHA** with `persist-credentials: false`, reference no
secret, and run the resolvers — sized on the assumption that `uv pip compile`
can build an sdist and execute third-party `setup.py`. The push job downloads
their artifacts and runs only `git` and `cp`, takes every trusted input from the
event payload, uses no `--force`, and refuses if the branch tip moved off the
SHA the resolvers ran against.

**The pnpm overrides check is the point of the workflow, not a detail.** Between
`--lockfile-only` and the upload it asserts every `pnpm.overrides` key is
present in the lockfile at the same value; a miss exits 1 *before* anything is
uploaded, so the push job has nothing to commit. There is no
`--no-frozen-lockfile` anywhere in the file — the automation must never become
the thing that quietly launders away the guard that caught #344/#351. That check
was extracted and run against the real files: passing intact, failing on a
deleted block, a dropped key and a weakened value.

**Two things remain unverified and are not claimed.** Whether the trigger fires
and whether the token's push to a Dependabot branch is accepted both need a real
Dependabot run. And a `GITHUB_TOKEN` push starts no new workflow run, so the
synced commit is *unverified rather than green* — closing that needs the same
PAT/GitHub-App operator step, which this design deliberately does not depend on.
The manual recipe in [backend/CLAUDE.md](../backend/CLAUDE.md) § Dependency lock
stays the documented fallback.
**Trigger for the remaining verification:** the next Dependabot manifest bump.
