# .claude/hooks/security-patterns.sh
#
# Cheap, fast pattern checks for security regressions in this AP
# system. Designed to run as a PostToolUse hook on Edit / Write /
# MultiEdit so violations surface to Claude before the next turn.
#
# Philosophy
# ----------
# Greps catch the bug classes that have a stable textual shape. Each
# rule answers: "What does the violation look like in code, and what
# is the safer replacement?" The rules below are tuned to:
#   1. Flag the specific regressions this codebase has been bitten by
#      (bcrypt truncation, missing HMAC, raw filename in S3 key, etc.)
#   2. Flag *broader* shapes that future bugs of the same class will
#      take — `Float` near a money-named column, `logger.* %s ... exc`,
#      `jwt.decode` outside the central helper, naive `datetime.now()`.
#
# Adding a new rule is one block. Rules MUST:
#   - Have a unique RULE_NAME
#   - State WHY they exist (so a maintainer can decide whether to
#     bypass with `# noqa: <rule>` or fix)
#   - State the safer alternative
#
# Bypass
# ------
# A reviewer who concludes a rule is wrong in a specific spot can
# append `# noqa: <rule_name>` to the line. The hook honours that
# token. Project-wide opt-out: comment the rule out of `RULES` below.
#
# Exit codes
# ----------
#   0 — no findings (or only on files outside the scope)
#   2 — at least one finding; stderr is shown to Claude as a
#       system-reminder so the next turn can address it
#
# Invocation
# ----------
# Wired in `.claude/settings.json` as a PostToolUse hook against
# Edit | Write | MultiEdit. The Claude Code runtime passes a JSON
# event on stdin; we extract the modified file path(s) from it.

set -euo pipefail

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Read the tool event from stdin and pull out the file paths.
# Claude Code passes `tool_input.file_path` for single-file tools and
# `tool_input.edits[].file_path` style structures for some others.
# Be forgiving — if we can't parse, fall back to scanning everything
# in `backend/` and `frontend/` that's been touched recently is too
# expensive; better to do nothing and let the agents catch it.

# ===== Python-only rules ===================================================
if [[ "$FILE" == *.py ]]; then

# ----- RULE: bcrypt without sha256 prehash --------------------------------
# Why: bcrypt truncates input at 72 bytes. Two long passwords sharing the
# first 72 chars hash equal — an attacker who guesses the prefix only has
# to brute-force the suffix. The repo standard is bcrypt_sha256 (which
# pre-hashes with SHA-256 before bcrypt). Bug class: any new hash-context
# instantiation that picks the wrong scheme.

# ----- RULE: exception interpolated into log message ----------------------
# Why: SDKs sometimes raise with the partial PAN, masked tax id, or
# account number in the exception message. Interpolating `exc` itself
# (vs `exc.__class__.__name__`) pushes that string into the log sink.
# Project invariant #7. Bug class: any new logger call that surfaces a
# raw exception object.

done < <(hits 'logger\.(info|warning|error)\(.*%s.*,\s*exc\)')

# ----- RULE: deprecated/naive datetime call -------------------------------
# Why: `datetime.now()` without tz is naive — comparing to a UTC value
# silently fails ordering. `datetime.utcnow()` is deprecated as of 3.12.
# The repo uses `datetime.now(UTC)` everywhere. Bug class: anything
# building a tz-naive timestamp and persisting / comparing it.

# ----- RULE: jwt.decode outside the central decoder -----------------------
# Why: `app.api.deps.decode_token` pins `algorithms=["HS256"]` and turns
# JWTError into a 401. A direct `jwt.decode` call elsewhere is liable
# to skip those guards — or worse, accept `algorithms=["HS256","none"]`.
# Bug class: anyone shortcutting around the decoder.

# ----- RULE: Float column on money-named field ----------------------------

# Floats and trust the cents. Bug class: any future model adding a
# money-named column with Float.

# ----- RULE: webhook endpoint without HMAC verification -------------------
# Why: project invariant #9. Every inbound webhook must verify the
# provider's signature. The shared helper is
# `services/webhook_security.verify_hmac_sha256`. Bug class: any new
# webhook handler that goes straight to body parsing.

# the status" without realising the audit row matters.

# enroll), private_key, signing_key, etc.

# component skips all of that. Bug class: future fetches that don't
# include tenant scoping or token rotation.
