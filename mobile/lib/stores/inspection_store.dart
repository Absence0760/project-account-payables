/// Quality-inspection list + the record-an-inspection write.
///
/// Shaped like [VendorStore] (list, filter, action-then-refetch) with two
/// deliberate differences:
///
/// * **The outcome filter is sent to the server** (`?result=`), never applied to
///   the loaded page. The list is paginated, so a client-side filter would hide
///   every matching row past the page boundary — which is how the approvals tab
///   once reported "all caught up" while invoices sat awaiting review.
/// * **Not offline-cached.** Every other list cached here is something to *read*
///   on a plane; this one exists to be written to, and the write needs the
///   network. Serving a stale pass/fail from disk would be worse than an honest
///   error: a `fail` is what puts a quality hold on a payable invoice, so a row
///   that looks current but predates a re-inspection is a wrong answer about
///   whether an invoice can be paid.
