/// Mirrors `backend/app/schemas/adaptive_workflows.py`. Three things about the
/// wire shape drive how this file is written:
///
/// * **Every statistic arrives as a STRING**, money and percentage alike — the
///   backend stringifies its `Decimal`s rather than floating them across the
///   boundary. They are carried as strings and rendered verbatim; the device
///   never parses or recomputes one. (The web page does the same.)
/// * **Per-vendor money figures carry no currency code.** They are denominated
///   in the org's reporting currency, which this payload does not name, so the
///   screen labels the section rather than stamping a symbol on each figure —
///   printing `$` on a ZAR org's averages would be a lie the API never told.
///   The anomaly rows are the exception: they carry their own `amount_currency`,
///   because `detect_invoice_anomaly` falls back to the BILLED figure when an
///   invoice has no usable rate lock.
/// * **Everything is advisory and deterministic** — statistics over the
///   tenant's own approval history, no model, recomputed on read. A suggestion
///   is a proposal; nothing here has changed a workflow.
