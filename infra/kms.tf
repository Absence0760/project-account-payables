# Customer-managed KMS key used for at-rest encryption of:
#   - RDS (backend DB)
#   - S3 objects in the invoice-files and audit-log buckets
#   - SQS queues that carry audit events
#
# SOPS uses a separate KMS key provisioned by `bin/sops-init.sh` out-of-band
# (chicken-and-egg: Terraform can't read its own encrypted tfvars before the
# key exists). That script flips `key_rotation_enabled` on at creation too —
# any new key spun up in-repo follows the same rule via this resource.
#
# `enable_key_rotation = true` is a SOC 2 engineering prereq
# (docs/soc2-readiness.md § Secrets management). Rotation is automatic and
# annual; AWS keeps the older key material around for decrypt, so nothing
# re-encrypts under the new material — but new encrypt operations use it.

# principal has no implicit grant on a customer-managed key (unlike the
# AWS-managed aws/s3 key) — without the statement below, Terraform applies
# cleanly but log delivery fails silently forever and no objects ever land
# in that bucket.
